<h2>THE GERMAN PRESS<br />
ON &#8220;SEX AND CHARACTER.&#8221;</h2>

<div class="reviews">

<p><i>Die Umschau.</i>&mdash;&#8220;Dr. Otto Weininger&#8217;s book is destined to place the
relation of the sexes in a new light. He traces the contrast between man
and woman to a single principle, and makes an attempt to reduce the
spiritual differences of the sexes to a system.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Allgemeine Wiener Medizinische Zeitung.</i>&mdash;&#8220;An extraordinary book,
that called forth the learned criticism of two faculties, and had appeared
in a third edition a few months after its publication, before the scientific
world had been able to pronounce upon it seriously, not to say finally....
A book that will henceforth be in the hands of every doctor who has
occasion to study the antithetical character of the two sexes.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Der Volkserzieher.</i>&mdash;&#8220;There is no aspect of modern thought which he
(Weininger) has not touched upon in the course of his investigations, no
recess of the labyrinthine modern soul into which he does not invite us to
glance with him, no question on which he has not touched, or to which he
has not, indeed, offered a solution in accordance with his own philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Allgemeine Zeitung.</i>&mdash;&#8220;This book ... is a sensational work, both by
reason of its contents and of the tragic fate of its author. Weininger, as
is commonly known, shot himself in the autumn of 1903 at the early age
of twenty-three, in the house in Vienna where Beethoven had died....
But it is the book itself, even more than its author&#8217;s individuality, which is
abnormal. It is nothing less than an attempt to construct a system of
sexual characterology on the broadest scientific basis, with all the resources
of the most modern philosophy.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>M&uuml;nchener Neueste Nachrichten.</i>&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Sex and Character,&#8217; by Dr.
Weininger, has none of the character of a youthful work. The learning
revealed in this book, and indeed its whole conception, are such that we
might take it for the strenuous achievement of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Neues Wiener Tageblatt.</i>&mdash;&#8220;A great philosophical, biological, and
social question is here treated by a gifted and learned author with perfect
freedom and breadth, yet with a seriousness, a wealth of scientific knowledge,
that would ensure the book a place in the front rank, even were the
style less excellent, vivacious, and individual than it is.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Die Wage.</i>&mdash;&#8220;The author is a brilliant stylist. On every page I find
aphorisms, in which the form fits the thought like a veil of silver. And
these thoughts are no ordinary ones. The writer goes his own way, he
knows secret paths which no man has yet trodden, and he shrinks from no
obstacles. He lets himself down cautiously into the abyss, for he has
determined to sound the deepest depths; from time to time, however, he
looks up from the pit and rejoices in the light of the eternal stars, even
though they lie hid from his mortal vision. He carries his arguments to
their ultimate conclusion. We rebel against these conclusions, but we
admire the uncompromising logic of the thinker.&#8221;</p>

<h2>PUBLISHER&#8217;S NOTE</h2>

<p>On October 4, 1903, Otto Weininger died by his own
hand, at the age of twenty-three and a half years. There
is perhaps in all history no other instance of a man who
had produced a work so mature in its scientific character,
and so original in its philosophical aspect as &#8220;Sex and
Character&#8221; when he was no more than twenty-one years
old. We will not attempt to decide whether this was the
case of a genius, who, instead of developing his intellectual
powers gradually in the course of a lifetime, concentrated
them in one mighty achievement, and then cast off the
worn-out husk of the flesh, or of an unhappy youth, who
could no longer bear the burden of his own ghastly knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sex and Character&#8221; is undoubtedly one of those rare
books that will be studied long after its own times, and
whose influence will not pass away, but will penetrate
deeper and deeper, compelling amazement and inviting
reflection in steadily expanding circles. It may be noted
with satisfaction that the book is by no means in harmony
with contemporary thought. The discussions, so much
in favour nowadays, concerning the emancipation of
women, sexuality, the relation of women to culture, and
so forth, are deprived of their data by this publication;
for here, laid down with all the penetrating acumen of the
trained logician, is a characterisation of sexual types,
&#8220;M&#8221; (the ideal man), and &#8220;W&#8221; (the ideal woman), which
traces all the much discussed psychological phenomena
back to a final source, and actually gives a definitive
solution to the feminine problem, a solution altogether
alien to the field of inquiry wherein the answer has hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
been sought. In the science of characterology, here
formulated for the first time, we have a strenuous scientific
achievement of the first importance. All former
psychologies have been the psychology of the male,
written by men, and more or less consciously applicable
only to man as distinguished from humanity. &#8220;Woman
does not betray her secret,&#8221; said Kant, and this has
been true till now. But now she has revealed it&mdash;by
the voice of a man. The things women say about themselves
have been suggested by men; they repeat the discoveries,
more or less real, which men have made about
them. By a highly original method of analysis, a man has
succeeded for the first time in giving scientific and abstract
utterance to that which only some few great artists have
suggested by concrete images hitherto. Weininger, working
out an original system of characterology (psychological
typology) rich in prospective possibilities, undertook
the construction of a universal psychology of woman
which penetrates to the nethermost depths, and is based
not only on a vast systematic mastery of scientific
knowledge, but on what can only be described as an appalling
comprehension of the feminine soul in its most
secret recesses. This newly created method embraces the
whole domain of human consciousness; research must be
carried out on the lines laid down by Nature&mdash;in three
stages, and from three distinct points of view: the
biologico-physiological, the psychologically descriptive,
and the philosophically appreciative. I will not dwell
here on the equipment essential for such a task, the
necessary combination of a comprehensive knowledge of
natural history with a minute and exhaustive mastery of
psychological and philosophical science&mdash;a combination
destined, perhaps, to prove unique.</p>

<p>The general characterisation of the ideal woman, &#8220;W,&#8221;
is followed by the construction of individual types, which
are finally resolved into two elemental figures (Platonic conceptions
to some extent), the Courtesan and the Mother.
These are differentiated by their pre-occupation with the<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevii">[vii]</span>
sexual act (the main, and in the ultimate sense, sole interest
of &#8220;W&#8221;), in the first case, as an end in itself, in the second
as the process which results in the possession of a child.
The abnormal type, the hysterical woman, leads up to a
masterly psychological (not physiological) theory of hysteria,
which is acutely and convincingly defined as &#8220;the organic
mendacity of woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weininger himself attached the highest importance to the
ethico-philosophical chapters that conclude his work, in
which he passes from the special problem of sexuality to the
problems of individual talent, genius, &aelig;sthetics, memory,
the <i>ego</i>, the Jewish race, and many others, rising finally to
the ultimate logical and moral principles of judgment.
From his most universal standpoint he succeeds in estimating
woman as a part of humanity, and, above all, subjectively.
Here he deliberately comes into sharp conflict
with the fashionable tendencies towards an unscientific
monism and its accompanying phenomena, pan-sexuality
and the ethics of species, and characterises very aptly the
customary superficialities of the many non-philosophical
modern apostles, of whom Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche and Ellen Key
are perhaps the most representative types. Weininger, in
defiance of all reigning fashions, represents a consolidated
dualism, closely related to the eternal systems of Plato, of
Christianity, and of Kant, which finds an original issue in
a bitterly tragic conception of the universe. Richard Wagner
(whom Weininger calls the greatest of human beings after
Jesus) gives artistic expression in his <i>Parsifal</i> to the conception
Weininger sets forth scientifically. It is, in fact,
the old doctrine of the divine life and of redemption to
which the whole book, with its array of detail, is consecrated.
In Kundry, Weininger recognises the most profound conception
of woman in all literature. In her redemption by
the spotless Parsifal, the young philosopher sees the way of
mankind marked out; he contrasts with this the programme
of the modern feminist movement, with its superficialities
and its lies; and so, in conclusion, the book returns to the
problem, which, in spite of all its wealth of thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Pageviii">[viii]</span>
remains its governing idea: the problem of the sexes and
the possibility of a moral relation between them&mdash;a moral
relation fundamentally different from what is commonly
understood by the term, of course. In the two chapters:
&#8220;The Nature of Woman and her significance in the
Universe,&#8221; and &#8220;Woman and Mankind,&#8221; we drink from
a fountain of the ripest wisdom. A tragic and most
unhappy mind reveals itself here, and no thoughtful
man will lay down this book without deep emotion
and admiration; many, indeed, will close it with almost
religious reverence.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR&#8217;S PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book is an attempt to place the relations of Sex in a
new and decisive light. It is an attempt not to collect the
greatest possible number of distinguishing characters, or
to arrange into a system all the results of scientific measuring
and experiment, but to refer to a single principle the
whole contrast between man and woman. In this respect
the book differs from all other works on the same subject.
It does not linger over this or that detail, but presses on to
its ultimate goal; it does not heap investigation on investigation,
but combines the psychical differences between the
sexes into a system; it deals not with women, but with
woman. It sets out, indeed, from the most common and
obvious facts, but intends to reach a single, concrete principle.
This is not &#8220;inductive metaphysics&#8221;; it is a gradual
approach to the heart of psychology.</p>

<p>The investigation is not of details, but of principles; it
does not despise the laboratory, although the help of the
laboratory, with regard to the deeper problems, is limited
as compared with the results of introspective analysis. An
artist who wishes to represent the female form can construct
a type without actually giving formal proof by a series of
measurements. The artist does not despise experimental
results; on the contrary, he regards it as a duty to gain
experience; but for him the collection of experimental
knowledge is merely a starting-point for self-exploration,
and in art self-exploration is exploration of the world.</p>

<p>The psychology used in this exposition is purely philosophical,
although its characteristic method, justified by the
subject, is to set out from the most trivial details of experience.
The task of the philosopher differs from that of<span class="pagenum" id="Pagex">[x]</span>
the artist in one important respect. The one deals in symbols,
the other in ideas. Art and philosophy stand to one
another as expression and meaning. The artist has breathed
in the world to breathe it out again; the philosopher has
the world outside him and he has to absorb it.</p>

<p>There is always something pretentious in theory; and the
real meaning&mdash;which in a work of art is Nature herself and
in a philosophical system is a much condensed generalisation,
a thesis going to the root of the matter and proving
itself&mdash;appears to strike against us harshly, almost offensively.
Where my exposition is anti-feminine, and that is nearly
everywhere, men themselves will receive it with little heartiness
or conviction; their sexual egoism makes them prefer
to see woman as they would like to have her, as they would
like her to be.</p>

<p>I need not say that I am prepared for the answer women
will have to the judgment I have passed on their sex. My
investigation, indeed, turns against man in the end, and
although in a deeper sense than the advocates of women&#8217;s
rights could anticipate, assigns to man the heaviest and
most real blame. But this will help me little and is of such
a nature that it cannot in the smallest way rehabilitate me
in the minds of women.</p>

<p>The analysis, however, goes further than the assignment
of blame; it rises beyond simple and superficial phenomena
to heights from which there opens not only a view into the
nature of woman and its meaning in the universe, but also
the relation to mankind and to the ultimate and most lofty
problems. A definite relation to the problem of Culture is
attained, and we reach the part to be played by woman in
the sphere of ideal aims. There, also, where the problems
of Culture and of Mankind coincide, I try not merely to
explain but to assign values, for, indeed, in that region
explanation and valuation are identical.</p>

<p>To such a wide outlook my investigation was as it were
driven, not deliberately steered, from the outset. The inadequacy
of all empirical psychological philosophy follows
directly from empirical psychology itself. The respect for<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexi">[xi]</span>
empirical knowledge will not be injured, but rather will the
meaning of such knowledge be deepened, if man recognises
in phenomena, and it is from phenomena that he sets out,
any elements assuring him that there is something behind
phenomena, if he espies the signs that prove the existence of
something higher than phenomena, something that supports
phenomena. We may be assured of such a first principle,
although no living man can reach it. Towards such a
principle this book presses and will not flag.</p>

<p>Within the narrow limits to which as yet the problem of
woman and of woman&#8217;s rights has been confined, there
has been no place for the venture to reach so high a goal.
None the less the problem is bound intimately with the
deepest riddles of existence. It can be solved, practically
or theoretically, morally or metaphysically, only in relation
to an interpretation of the cosmos.</p>

<p>Comprehension of the universe, or what passes for such,
stands in no opposition to knowledge of details; on the
other hand all special knowledge acquires a deeper meaning
because of it. Comprehension of the universe is self-creative;
it cannot arise, although the empirical knowledge
of every age expects it, as a synthesis of however great a
sum of empirical knowledge.</p>

<p>In this book there lie only the germs of a world-scheme,
and these are allied most closely with the conceptions of
Plato, Kant and Christianity. I have been compelled for
the most part to fashion for myself the scientific, psychological,
philosophical, logical, ethical groundwork. I think
that at the least I have laid the foundations of many things
into which I could not go fully. I call special attention to
the defects of this part of my work because I attach more
importance to appreciation of what I have tried to say
about the deepest and most general problems than to the
interest which will certainly be aroused by my special
investigation of the problem of woman.</p>

<p>The philosophical reader may take it amiss to find a
treatment of the loftiest and ultimate problems coinciding
with the investigation of a special problem of no great<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexii">[xii]</span>
dignity; I share with him this distaste. I may say, however,
that I have treated throughout the contrast between
the sexes as the starting-point rather than the goal of my
research. The investigation has yielded a harvest rich in
its bearing on the fundamental problems of logic and their
relations to the axioms of thought, on the theory of &aelig;sthetics,
of love, and of the beautiful and the good, and on problems
such as individuality and morality and their relations, on
the phenomena of genius, the craving for immortality and
Hebraism. Naturally these comprehensive interrelations aid
the special problem, for, as it is considered from so many
points of view, its scope enlarges. And if in this wider
sense it be proved that culture can give only the smallest
hope for the nature of woman, if the final results are a
depreciation, even a negation of womanhood, there will be
no attempt in this to destroy what exists, to humble what
has a value of its own. Horror of my own deed would
overtake me were I here only destructive and had I left only
a clean sheet. Perhaps the affirmations in my book are less
articulate, but he that has ears to hear will hear them.</p>

<p>The treatise falls into two parts, the first biological-psychological,
the second logical-philosophical. It may be
objected that I should have done better to make two books,
the one treating of purely physical science, the other introspective.
It was necessary to be done with biology before
turning to psychology. The second part treats of certain
psychical problems in a fashion totally different from the
method of any contemporary naturalist, and for that reason
I think that the removal of the first part of the book would
have been at some risk to many readers. Moreover, the
first part of the book challenges an attention and criticism
from natural science possible in a few places only in the
second part, which is chiefly introspective. Because the
second part starts from a conception of the universe that is
anti-positivistic, many will think it unscientific (although
there is given a strong proof against Positivism). For the
present I must be content with the conviction that I have
rendered its due to Biology, and that I have established<span class="pagenum" id="Pagexiii">[xiii]</span>
an enduring position for non-biological, non-physiological
psychology.</p>

<p>My investigation may be objected to as in certain points
not being supported by enough proof, but I see little force
in such an objection. For in these matters what can
&#8220;proof&#8221; mean? I am not dealing with mathematics or
with the theory of cognition (except with the latter in two
cases); I am dealing with empirical knowledge, and in that
one can do no more than point to what exists; in this
region proof means no more than the agreement of new
experience with old experience, and it is much the same
whether the new phenomena have been produced experimentally
by men, or have come straight from the creative
hand of nature. Of such latter proofs my book contains
many.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to say that my book, if I may be
allowed to judge it, is for the most part not of a quality to
be understood and absorbed at the first glance. I point out
this myself, to guide and protect the reader.</p>

<p>The less I found myself able in both parts of the book
(and especially in the second) to confirm what now passes
for knowledge, the more anxious I have been to point out
coincidences where I found myself in agreement with what
has already been known and said.</p>

<p>I have to thank Professor Dr. Laurenz M&uuml;llner for the great
assistance he has given me, and Professor Dr. Friedrich
Jodl for the kindly interest he has taken in my work from
the beginning. I am specially indebted to the kind friends
who have helped me with correction of the proofs.</p>

SEXUAL COMPLEXITY</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page1">[1]</span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>All thought begins with conceptions to a certain extent
generalised, and thence is developed in two directions. On
the one hand, generalisations become wider and wider,
binding together by common properties a larger and larger
number of phenomena, and so embracing a wider field of
the world of facts. On the other hand, thought approaches
more closely the meeting-point of all conceptions, the
individual, the concrete complex unit towards which we
approach only by thinking in an ever-narrowing circle, and
by continually being able to add new specific and differentiating
attributes to the general idea, &#8220;thing,&#8221; or &#8220;something.&#8221;
It was known that fishes formed a class of the
animal kingdom distinct from mammals, birds, or invertebrates,
long before it was recognised on the one hand that
fishes might be bony or cartilaginous, or on the other that
fishes, birds and mammals composed a group differing from
the invertebrates by many common characters.</p>

<p>The self-assertion of the mind over the world of facts
in all its complexity of innumerable resemblances and
differences has been compared with the rule of the struggle
for existence among living beings. Our conceptions stand
between us and reality. It is only step by step that we
can control them. As in the case of a madman, we may first
have to throw a net over the whole body so that some
limit may be set to his struggles; and only after the whole
has been thus secured, is it possible to attend to the proper
restraint of each limb.</p>

<p>Two general conceptions have come down to us from
primitive mankind, and from the earliest times have held
our mental processes in their leash. Many a time these<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
conceptions have undergone trivial corrections; they have
been sent to the workshop and patched in head and limbs;
they have been lopped and added to, expanded here, contracted
there, as when new needs pierce through and
through an old law of suffrage, bursting bond after bond.
None the less, in spite of all amendment and alteration, we
have still to reckon with the primitive conceptions, male
and female.</p>

<p>It is true that among those we call women are some who
are meagre, narrow-hipped, angular, muscular, energetic,
highly mentalised; there are &#8220;women&#8221; with short hair and
deep voices, just as there are &#8220;men&#8221; who are beardless and
gossiping. We know, in fact, that there are unwomanly
women, man-like women, and unmanly, womanish, woman-like
men. We assign sex to human beings from their birth
on one character only, and so come to add contradictory
ideas to our conceptions. Such a course is illogical.</p>

<p>In private conversation or in society, in scientific or
general meetings, we have all taken part in frothy discussions
on &#8220;Man and Woman,&#8221; or on the &#8220;Emancipation of
Women.&#8221; There is a pitiful monotony in the fashion
according to which, on such occasions, &#8220;men&#8221; and
&#8220;women&#8221; have been treated as if, like red and white balls,
they were alike in all respects save colour. In no case
has the discussion been confined to an individual case, and
as every one had different individuals in their mind, a real
agreement was impossible. As people meant different things
by the same words, there was a complete disharmony between
language and ideas. Is it really the case that all
women and men are marked off sharply from each other,
the women, on the one hand, alike in all points, the men on
the other? It is certainly the case that all previous treatment
of the sexual differences, perhaps unconsciously, has
implied this view. And yet nowhere else in nature is there
such a yawning discontinuity. There are transitional forms
between the metals and non-metals, between chemical combinations
and mixtures, between animals and plants, between
phanerogams and cryptogams, and between mammals and<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
birds. It is only in obedience to the most general, practical
demand for a superficial view that we classify, make sharp
divisions, pick out a single tune from the continuous melody
of nature. But the old conceptions of the mind, like the
customs of primitive commerce, become foolish in a new
age. From the analogies I have given, the improbability
may henceforward be taken for granted of finding in nature
a sharp cleavage between all that is masculine on the one
side and all that is feminine on the other; or that a living
being is so simple in this respect that it can be put wholly
on one side or the other of the line. Matters are not so
clear.</p>

<p>In the controversy as to the woman question, appeal has
been made to the arbitration of anatomy, in the hope that
by that aid a line could be drawn between those characters
of males or females that are unalterable because inborn,
and those that are acquired. (It was a strange adventure to
attempt to decide the differences between the natural
endowment of men and women on anatomical results;
to suppose that if all other investigation failed to establish
the difference, the matter could be settled by a few more
grains of brain-weight on the one side.) However, the
answer of the anatomists is clear enough, whether it refer
to the brain or to any other portion of the body; absolute
sexual distinctions between all men on the one side and all
women on the other do not exist. Although the skeleton of
the hand of most men is different from that of most women
yet the sex cannot be determined with certainty either from
the skeleton or from an isolated part with its muscles,
tendons, skin, blood and nerves. The same is true of the
chest, sacrum or skull. And what are we to say of the
pelvis, that part of the skeleton in which, if anywhere, striking
sexual differences exist? It is almost universally believed that
in the one case the pelvis is adapted for the act of parturition,
in the other case is not so adapted. And yet the character
of the pelvis cannot be taken as an absolute criterion of sex.
There are to be found, and the wayfarer knows this as well
as the anatomist, many women with narrow male-like pelves<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
and many men with the broad pelves of women. Are we
then to make nothing of sexual differences? That would
imply, almost, that we could not distinguish between men
and women.</p>

<p>From what quarter are we to seek help in our problem?
The old doctrine is insufficient, and yet we cannot make
shift without it. If the received ideas do not suffice, it
must be our task to seek out new and better guides.</p>

<h2><span class="chapno">CHAPTER I</span><br />
<span class="chaptitle">&#8220;MALES&#8221; AND &#8220;FEMALES&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>In the widest treatment of most living things, a blunt separation
of them into males or females no longer suffices for the
known facts. The limitations of these conceptions have
been felt more or less by many writers. The first purpose
of this work is to make this point clear.</p>

<p>I agree with other authors who, in a recent treatment of
the facts connected with this subject, have taken as a starting-point
what has been established by embryology regarding
the existence in human beings, plants, and animals of
an embryonic stage neutral as regards sex.</p>

<p>In the case of a human embryo of less than five weeks,
for instance, the sex to which it would afterwards belong
cannot be recognised. In the fifth week of f&#339;tal life processes
begin which, by the end of the fifth month of pregnancy,
have turned the genital rudiments, at first alike in
the sexes, into one sex and have determined the sex of the
whole organism. The details of these processes need not
be described more fully here. It can be shown that however
distinctly unisexual an adult plant, animal or human
being may be, there is always a certain persistence of the
bisexual character, never a complete disappearance of the
characters of the undeveloped sex. Sexual differentiation, in
fact, is never complete. All the peculiarities of the male sex
may be present in the female in some form, however weakly
developed; and so also the sexual characteristics of the
woman persist in the man, although perhaps they are not
so completely rudimentary. The characters of the other
sex occur in the one sex in a vestigial form. Thus, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
case of human beings, in which our interest is greatest, to
take an example, it will be found that the most womanly
woman has a growth of colourless hair, known as &#8220;lanugo&#8221;
in the position of the male beard; and in the most manly
man there are developed under the skin of the breast masses
of glandular tissue connected with the nipples. This condition
of things has been minutely investigated in the true
genital organs and ducts, the region called the &#8220;urino-genital
tract,&#8221; and in each sex there has been found a complete
but rudimentary set of parallels to the organs of the other
sex.</p>

<p>These embryological conclusions can be brought into
relation with another set of facts. Haeckel has used the
word &#8220;gonochorism&#8221; for the separation of the sexes, and
in different classes and groups of creatures different
degrees of gonochorism may be noted. Different kinds
of animals and plants may be distinguished by the extent
to which the characters of one sex are rudimentary in the
other. The most extreme case of sexual differentiation, the
sharpest gonochorism, occurs in sexual dimorphism, that is
to say, in that condition of affairs in which (as for instance
in some water-fleas) the males and females of the same
species differ as much or even more from each other as the
members of different species, or genera. There is not so
sharply marked gonochorism amongst vertebrates as in the
case of crustacea or insects. Amongst the former there does
not exist a distinction between males and females so complete
as to reach sexual dimorphism. A condition much more
frequent amongst them is the occurrence of forms intermediate
in regard to sex, what is called abnormal hermaphroditism;
whilst in certain fishes hermaphroditism is the
normal condition.</p>

<p>I must point out here that it must not be assumed that
there exist only extreme males with scanty remnants of the
female condition, extreme females with traces of the male,
hermaphrodite or transitional forms, and wide gaps between
these conditions. I am dealing specially with human beings,
but what I have to say of them might be applied, with more<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
or less modification, to nearly all creatures in which sexual
reproduction takes place.</p>

<p>Amongst human beings the state of the case is as follows:
There exist all sorts of intermediate conditions between male
and female&mdash;sexual transitional forms. In physical inquiries
an &#8220;ideal gas&#8221; is assumed, that is to say, a gas, the behaviour
of which follows the law of Boyle-Gay-Lussac
exactly, although, in fact, no such gas exists, and laws are
deduced from this so that the deviations from the ideal laws
may be established in the case of actually existing gases. In
the same fashion we may suppose the existence of an ideal
man, M, and of an ideal woman, W, as sexual types
although these types do not actually exist. Such types not
only can be constructed, but must be constructed. As in
art so in science, the real purpose is to reach the type, the
Platonic Idea. The science of physics investigates the
behaviour of bodies that are absolutely rigid or absolutely
elastic, in the full knowledge that neither the one nor the
other actually exists. The intermediate conditions actually
existing between the two absolute states of matter serve
merely as a starting-point for investigation of the &#8220;types&#8221;
and in the practical application of the theory are treated
as mixtures and exhaustively analysed. So also there
exist only the intermediate stages between absolute males
and females, the absolute conditions never presenting themselves.</p>

<p>Let it be noted clearly that I am discussing the existence
not merely of embryonic sexual neutrality, but of a permanent
bisexual condition. Nor am I taking into consideration
merely those intermediate sexual conditions,
those bodily or psychical hermaphrodites upon which, up
to the present, attention has been concentrated. In
another respect my conception is new. Until now, in dealing
with sexual intermediates, only hermaphrodites were
considered; as if, to use a physical analogy, there were in
between the two extremes a single group of intermediate
forms, and not an intervening tract equally beset with stages
in different degrees of transition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span></p>

<p>The fact is that males and females are like two substances
combined in different proportions, but with either
element never wholly missing. We find, so to speak,
never either a man or a woman, but only the male condition
and the female condition. Any individual, &#8220;A&#8221; or
&#8220;B,&#8221; is never to be designated merely as a man or a
woman, but by a formula showing that it is a composite
of male and female characters in different proportions, for
instance, as follows:</p>

<p>Further proofs of the validity of this conception are
numerous, and I have already given, in the preface, a
few of the most general. We may recall the existence of
&#8220;men&#8221; with female pelves and female breasts, with narrow
waists, overgrowth of the hair of the head; or of
&#8220;women&#8221; with small hips and flat breasts, with deep bass
voices and beards (the presence of hair on the chin is
more common than is supposed, as women naturally are at
pains to remove it; I am not speaking of the special growth
that often appears on the faces of women who have reached
middle age). All such peculiarities, many of them coinciding
in the same individuals, are well known to doctors
and anatomists, although their general significance has not
been understood.</p>

<p>One of the most striking proofs of the view that I have
been unfolding is presented by the great range of numerical
variation to be found where sexual characters have been
measured either by the same or by different anthropological
or anatomical workers. The figures obtained by measuring
female characters do not begin where those got from males
leave off, but the two sets overlap. The more obvious this
uncertainty in the theory of sexual intermediate forms may
be, the more is it to be deplored in the interests of true
science. Anatomists and anthropologists of the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
type have by no means striven against the scientific representation
of the sexual types, but as for the most part they
regarded measurements as the best indications, they were
overwhelmed with the number of exceptions, and thus, so
far, measurement has brought only vague and indefinite
results.</p>

<p>The course of statistical science, which marks off our industrial
age from earlier times, although perhaps on account
of its distant relation to mathematics it has been regarded
as specially scientific, has in reality hindered the progress of
knowledge. It has dealt with averages, not with types. It
has not been recognised that in pure, as opposed to applied,
science it is the type that must be studied. And so those
who are concerned with the type must turn their backs on
the methods and conclusions of current morphology and
physiology. The real measurements and investigations of
details have yet to be made. Those that now exist are
inapplicable to true science.</p>

<p>Knowledge must be obtained of male and female by means
of a right construction of the ideal man and the ideal woman,
using the word ideal in the sense of typical, excluding judgment
as to value. When these types have been recognised
and built up we shall be in a position to consider individual
cases, and their analysis as mixtures in different proportions
will be neither difficult not fruitless.</p>

<p>I shall now give a summary of the contents of this chapter.
Living beings cannot be described bluntly as of one
sex or the other. The real world from the point of view of
sex may be regarded as swaying between two points, no
actual individual being at either point, but somewhere between
the two. The task of science is to define the position
of any individual between these two points. The absolute
conditions at the two extremes are not metaphysical abstractions
above or outside the world of experience, but their
construction is necessary as a philosophical and practical
mode of describing the actual world.</p>

<p>A presentiment of this bisexuality of life (derived from the
actual absence of complete sexual differentiation) is very old.<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
Traces of it may be found in Chinese myths, but it became
active in Greek thought. We may recall the mythical personification
of bisexuality in the Hermaphroditos, the
narrative of Aristophanes in the Platonic dialogue, or in later
times the suggestion of a Gnostic sect (Theophites) that
primitive man was a &#8220;man-woman.&#8221;</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER II</span><br />
MALE AND FEMALE PLASMAS</h3>

<p>The first thing expected of a book like this, the avowed
object of which is a complete revision of facts hitherto
accepted, is that it should expound a new and satisfactory
account of the anatomical and physiological characters of
the sexual types. Quite apart from the abstract question as
to whether the complete survey of a subject so enormous
is not beyond the powers of one individual, I must at once
disclaim any intention of making the attempt. I do not
pretend to have made sufficient independent investigations
in a field so wide, nor do I think such a review necessary
for the purpose of this book. Nor is it necessary to give a
compilation of the results set out by other authors, for
Havelock Ellis has already done this very well. Were I to
attempt to reach the sexual types by means of the probable
inferences drawn from his collected results, my work would
be a mere hypothesis and science might have been spared a
new book. The arguments in this chapter, therefore, will
be of a rather formal and general nature; they will relate to
biological principles, but to a certain extent will lay stress
on the need for a closer investigation of certain definite
points, work which must be left to the future, but which
may be rendered more easy by my indications.</p>

<p>Those who know little of Biology may scan this section
hastily, and yet run little risk of failing to understand what
follows.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the existence of different degrees of
masculinity and femininity may be treated, in the first place,
on purely anatomical lines. Not only the anatomical form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
but the anatomical position of male and female characters
must be discussed. The examples already given of sexual
differences in other parts of the body showed that sexuality
is not limited to the genital organs and glands. But where
are the limits to be placed? Do they not reach beyond the
primary and secondary sexual characters? In other words,
where does sex display itself, and where is it without
influence?</p>

<p>Many points came to light in the last decade, which bring
fresh support to a theory first put forward in 1840, but
which at the time found little support since it appeared to
be in direct opposition to facts held as established alike
by the author of the theory and by his opponents. The
theory in question, first suggested by the zoologist J. J. S.
Steenstrup, of Copenhagen, but since supported by many
others, is that sexual characters are present in every part
of the body.</p>

<p>Ellis has collected the results of investigations on almost
every tissue of the body, which serve to show the universal
presence of sexual differences. It is plain that there is a
striking difference in the coloration of the typical male
and female. This fact establishes the existence of sexual
differences in the skin (cutis) and in the blood-vessels, and
also in the bulk of the colouring-matter in the blood and in
the number of red corpuscles to the cubic centimetre of the
blood fluid. Bischoff and Rudinger have proved the existence
of sexual differences in brain weight, and more recently
Justus and Alice Gaule have obtained a similar result with
regard to such vegetative organs as the liver, lungs and
spleen. In fact, all parts of a woman, although in different
degrees in different zones, have a sexual stimulus for the
male organism, and similarly all parts of the male have their
effect on the female.</p>

<p>The direct logical inference may be drawn, and is supported
by abundant facts, that every cell in the body is
sexually characteristic and has its definite sexual significance.
I may now add to the principle already laid down in
this book, of the universal presence of sexually intermediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
conditions, that these conditions may present different
degrees of development. Such a conception of the existence
of different degrees of development in sexuality makes
it easy to understand cases of false hermaphroditism or even
of the true hermaphroditism, which, since the time of
Steenstrup, has been established for so many plants and
animals, although not certainly in the case of man. Steenstrup
wrote: &#8220;If the sex of an animal has its seat only in
the genital organs, then one might think it possible for an
animal really to be bisexual, if it had at the same time two
sets of sexual organs. But sex is not limited to one region,
it manifests itself not merely by the presence of certain
organs; it pervades the whole being and shows itself in
every point. In a male body, everything down to the
smallest part is male, however much it may resemble the
corresponding female part, and so also in the female the
smallest part is female. The presence of male and female
sexual organs in the same body would make the body
bisexual only if both sexes ruled the whole body and made
themselves manifest in every point, and such a condition, as
the manifestations of the sexes are opposing forces, would
result simply in the negation of sex in the body in question.&#8221;
If, however, the principle of the existence of innumerable
sexually transitional conditions be extended to all the cells
of the body, and empirical knowledge supports such a view,
Steenstrup&#8217;s difficulty is resolved, and hermaphroditism no
longer appears to be unnatural. There may be conceived
for every cell all conditions, from complete masculinity
through all stages of diminishing masculinity to its complete
absence and the consequent presence of complete
femininity. Whether we are to think of these gradations in
the scale of sexual differentiation as depending on two real
substances united in different proportions, or as a single
kind of protoplasm modified in different ways (as, for
instance, by different spatial dispositions of its molecules),
it were wiser not to guess. The first conception is difficult
to apply physiologically; it is extremely difficult to imagine
that two sets of conditions should be able to produce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
essential physiological similarities of two bodies, one with a
male and the other a female diathesis. The second view
recalls too vividly certain unfortunate speculations on
heredity. Perhaps both views are equally far from the
truth. At present empirical knowledge does not enable us
to say wherein the masculinity or the femininity of a cell
really lies, or to define the histological, molecular or
chemical differences which distinguish every cell of a male
from every cell of a female. Without anticipating any discovery
of the future (it is plain already, however, that the
specific phenomena of living matter are not going to be
referred to chemistry and physics), it may be taken for
granted that individual cells possess sexuality in different
degrees quite apart from the sexuality of the whole body.
Womanish men usually have the skin softer, and in them
the cells of the male organs have a lessened power of
division upon which depends directly the poorer development
of the male macroscopic characters.</p>

<p>The distribution of sexual characters affords an important
proof of the appearance of sexuality in different degrees.
Such characters (at least in the animal kingdom) may be
arranged according to the strength of their exciting influence
on the opposite sex. To avoid confusion, I shall
make use of John Hunter&#8217;s terms for classifying sexual
characters. The primordial sexual characters are the male
and female genital glands (testes and epididymis, ovaries
and epoophoron); the primary sexual characters are the
internal appendages of the sexual glands (vasa deferentia
vesicul&aelig; seminales, oviducts and uterus), which may have
sexual characters quite distinct from those of the glands
and the external sexual organs, according to which alone
the sex of human beings is reckoned at birth (sometimes
quite erroneously, as I shall show) and their consequent fate
in life decided. After the primary, come all those sexual
characters not directly necessary to reproduction. Such
secondary sexual characters are best defined as those which
begin to appear at puberty, and which cannot be developed
except under the influence on the system of the internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
secretions of the genital glands. Examples of these are the
beards in men, the luxuriant growth of hair in women, the
development of the mammary glands, the character of the
voice. As a convenient mode of treatment, and for practical
rather than theoretical reasons, certain inherited characters,
such as the development of muscular strength or of mental
obstinacy may be reckoned as tertiary sexual characters.
Under the designation &#8220;quaternary sexual characters&#8221; may
be placed such accessories as relative social position, difference
in habit, mode of livelihood, the smoking and drinking
habit in man, and the domestic duties of women. All these
characters possess a potent and direct sexual influence, and
in my opinion often may be reckoned with the tertiary
characters or even with the secondary. This classification
of sexual characters must not be taken as implying a definite
chain of sequence, nor must it be assumed that the
mental sexual characters either determine the bodily characters
or are determined by them in some causal nexus. The
classification relates only to the strength of the exciting
influence on the other sex, to the order in time in which
this influence is exerted, and to the degree of certainty with
which the extent of the influence may be predicted.</p>

<p>Study of secondary sexual characters is bound up with
consideration of the effect of internal secretions of the
genital glands on general metabolism. The relation of this
influence or its absence (as in the case of artificially castrated
animals) has been traced out in the degree of development
of the secondary characters. The internal
secretions, however, undoubtedly have an influence on all
the cells of the body. This is clearly shown by the changes
which occur at puberty in all parts of the body, and not only
in the seats of the secondary sexual characters. As a matter
of fact, the internal secretions of all the glands must be
regarded as affecting all the tissues.</p>

<p>The internal secretions of the genital glands must be
regarded as completing the sexuality of the individual.
Every cell must be considered as possessing an original
sexuality, to which the influence of the internal secretion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
sufficient quantity is the final determining condition under
the influence of which the cell acquires its final determinate
character as male or female.</p>

<p>The genital glands are the organs in which the sex of the
individual is most obvious, and in the component cells of
which it is most conspicuously visible. At the same time it
must be noted that the distinguishing characters of the
species, race and family to which an organism belongs are
also best marked in the genital cells. Just as Steenstrup, on
the one hand, was right in teaching that sex extends all over
the body and is not confined to the genital organs, so, on
the other hand, Naegeli, de Vries, Oskar Hertwig and others
have propounded the important theory, and supported it
by weighty arguments, that every cell in a multi-cellular
organism possesses a combination of the characters of its
species and race, but that these characters are, as it were,
specially condensed in the sexual cells. Probably this view
of the case will come to be accepted by all investigators,
since every living being owes its origin to the cleavage and
multiplication of a single cell.</p>

<p>Many phenomena, amongst which may be noticed
specially experiments on the regeneration of lost parts and
investigations into the chemical differences between the
corresponding tissues of nearly allied animals, have led the
investigators to whom I have just referred to conceive the
existence of an &#8220;Idioplasm,&#8221; which is the bearer of the
specific characters, and which exists in all the cells of a
multi-cellular animal, quite apart from the purposes of reproduction.
In a similar fashion I have been led to the
conception of an &#8220;Arrhenoplasm&#8221; (male plasm) and a
&#8220;Thelyplasm&#8221; (female plasm) as the two modes in which
the idioplasm of every bisexual organism may appear, and
which are to be considered, because of reasons which I
shall explain, as ideal conditions between which the actual
conditions always lie. Actually existing protoplasm is to be
thought of as moving from an ideal arrhenoplasm through
a real or imaginary indifferent condition (true hermaphroditism)
towards a protoplasm that approaches, but never<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
actually reaches, an ideal thelyplasm. This conception
brings to a point what I have been trying to say. I apologise
for the new terms, but they are more than devices to
call attention to a new idea.</p>

<p>The proof that every single organ, and further, that every
single cell possesses a sexuality lying somewhere between
arrhenoplasm and thelyplasm, and further, that every cell
received an original sexual endowment definite in kind and
degree, is to be found in the fact that even in the same
organism the different cells do not always possess their
sexuality identical in kind and degree. In fact each cell of
a body neither contains the same proportion of M and
W nor is at the same approximation to arrhenoplasm or
thelyplasm; similar cells of the same body may indeed lie
on different sides of the sexually neutral point. If, instead
of writing &#8220;masculinity&#8221; and &#8220;femininity&#8221; at length, we
choose signs to express these, and without any malicious
intention choose the positive sign (+) for M and the
negative (-) for W, then our proposition may be expressed
as follows: The sexuality of the different cells of
the same organism differs not only in absolute quantity but
is to be expressed by a different sign. There are many men
with a poor growth of beard and a weak muscular development
who are otherwise typically males; and so also many
women with badly developed breasts are otherwise typically
womanly. There are womanish men with strong beards
and masculine women with abnormally short hair who
none the less possess well-developed breasts and broad
pelves. I know several men who have the upper part of
the thigh of a female with a normally male under part, and
some with the right hip of a male and the left of a female.
In most cases these local variations of the sexual character
affect both sides of the body, although of course it is only in
ideal bodies that there is complete symmetry about the
middle line. The degree to which sexuality displays itself,
however, as, for instance, in the growth of hair, is very often
unsymmetrical. This want of uniformity (and the sexual
manifestations never show complete uniformity) can hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
depend on differences of the internal secretion; for the
blood goes to all the organs, having in it the same amount
of the internal secretion; although different organs may
receive different quantities of blood, in all normal cases its
quality and quantity being proportioned to the needs of the
part.</p>

<p>Were we not to assume as the cause of these variations the
presence of a sexual determinant generally different in every
cell but stable from its earliest embryonic development, then
it would be simple to describe the sexuality of any individual
by estimating how far its sexual glands conformed to the
normal type of its sex, and the facts would be much simpler
than they really are. Sexuality, however, cannot be regarded
as occurring in an imaginary normal quantity distributed
equally all over an individual so that the sexual character of
any cell would be a measure of the sexual characters of
any other cells. Whilst, as an exception, there may occur
wide differences in the sexual characters of different cells
or organs of the same body, still as a rule there is the same
specific sexuality for all the cells. In fact it may be taken
as certain that an approximation to a complete uniformity
of sexual character over the whole body is much more
common than the tendency to any considerable divergences
amongst the different organs or still more amongst the
different cells. How far these possible variations may go
can be determined only by the investigation of individual
cases.</p>

<p>There is a popular view, dating back to Aristotle and
supported by many doctors and zoologists, that the castration
of an animal is followed by the sudden appearance of
the characters of the other sex; if the gelding of a male
were to bring about the appearance of female characteristics
then doubt would be thrown on the existence in every cell
of a primordial sexuality independent of the genital glands.
The most recent experimental results of Sellheim and
Foges, however, have shown that the type of a gelded male
is distinct from the female type, that gelding does not
induce the feminine character. It is better to avoid too<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
far-reaching and radical conclusions on this matter; it may
be that a second latent gland of the other sex may awake
into activity and sexually dominate the deteriorating organism
after the removal or atrophy of the normal gland.
There are many cases (too readily interpreted as instances
of complete assumption of the male character) in which
after the involution of the female sexual glands at the
climacteric the secondary sexual characters of the male are
acquired. Instances of this are the beard of the human
grandam, the occasional appearance of short antlers in old
does, or of a cock&#8217;s plumage in an old hen. But such
changes are practically never seen except in association
with senile decay or with operative interference.</p>

<p>In the case of certain crustacean parasites of fish, however
(the genera <i>Cymothoa</i>, <i>Anilocra</i> and <i>Nerocila</i> of the
family <i>Cymothoid&aelig;</i>), the changes I have just mentioned are
part of the normal life history. These creatures are hermaphrodites
of a peculiar kind; the male and female organs
co-exist in them but are not functional at the same period.
A sort of protandry exists; each individual exercises first
the functions of a male and afterwards those of the female.
During the time of their activity as males they possess
ordinary male reproductive organs which are cast off when
the female genital ducts and brood organs develop. That
similar conditions may exist in man has been shown by
those cases of &#8220;eviratio&#8221; and &#8220;effeminatio&#8221; which the
sexual pathology of the old age of men has brought to
light. So also we cannot deny altogether the actual occurrence
of a certain degree of effeminacy when the crucial
operation of extirpation of the human testes has been
performed.<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On the other hand, the fact that the relation
is not universal or inevitable, that the castration of an
individual does not certainly result in the appearance of the
characters of the other sex, may be taken as a proof that
it is necessary to assume the original presence throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
the body of cells determined by arrhenoplasm or
thelyplasm.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote1"><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> So also in the opposite case; it cannot be wholly denied that
ovariotomy is followed by the appearance of masculine characters.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The possession by every cell of primitive sexuality on
which the secretion of the sexual glands has little effect
might be shown further by consideration of the effects of
grafting male genital glands on female organisms. For such
an experiment to be accurate it would be necessary that the
animal from which the testis was to be transplanted should
be as near akin as possible to the female on which the testis
was to be grafted, as, for instance, in the case of a brother and
sister; the idioplasm of the two should be as alike as possible.
In this experiment much would depend on limiting the
conditions of the experiment as much as possible so that
the results would not be confused by conflicting factors.
Experiments made in Vienna have shown that when an
exchange of the ovaries has been made between unrelated
female animals (chosen at random) the atrophy of the
ovaries follows, but that there is no failure of the secondary
sexual characters (<i>e.g.</i>, degeneration of the mamm&aelig;). Moreover,
when the genital glands of an animal are removed from
their natural position and grafted in a new position in the
same animal (so that it still retains its own tissues) the full
development of the secondary sexual characters goes on
precisely as if there had been no interference, at least in
cases where the operation is successful. The failure of the
transplantation of ovaries from one animal to another may
be due to the absence of family relationship between the
tissues; the influence of the idioplasm probably is of primary
importance.</p>

<p>These experiments closely resemble those made in the
transfusion of alien blood. It is a practical rule with
surgeons that when a dangerous loss of blood has to be
made good, the blood required for transfusion must be
obtained from an individual not only of the same species
and family, but also of the same sex as that of the patient.
The parallel between transfusion and transplantation is at
once evident. If I am correct in my views, when surgeons
seek to transfuse blood, instead of being content with injections<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
of normal salt solution they must take the blood not
merely from one of the same species, family and sex, but
of a similar degree of masculinity or femininity.</p>

<p>Experiments on transfusion not only lend support to my
belief in the existence of sex characters in the blood corpuscles,
but they furnish additional explanations of the
failure of experiments in grafting ovaries or testis on individuals
of the opposite sex. The internal secretions of the
genital glands are operative only in their appropriate environment
of arrhenoplasm or thelyplasm.</p>

<p>In this connection, I may say a word as to the curative
value of organotherapy. Although, as I have shown to be
the case, the transplantation of freshly extirpated genital
glands into subjects of the opposite sex has no effect, it does
not follow that the injection of the ovarian secretion into
the blood of a male might not have a most injurious effect.
On the other hand, the principle of organotherapy has been
opposed on the ground that organic preparations procured
from non-allied species could not possibly be expected to
yield good results. It is more than likely that the medical
exponents of organotherapy have lost many valuable discoveries
in healing because of their neglect of the biological
theory of idioplasm.</p>

<p>The theory of an idioplasm, the presence of which gives
the specific race characters to those tissues and cells which
have lost the reproductive faculty, is by no means generally
accepted. But at the least all must admit that the race
characters are collected in the genital glands, and that if
experiments with extracts from these are to provide more
than a good tonic, the nearest possible relationship between
the animals experimented upon must be observed. Parallel
experiments might be made as to the effect of transplantation
of the genital glands and injections of their extracts on two
castrated cocks of the same strain. For instance, the effects
of the transplantation of the testes of one of them into any
other part of its own body or peritoneal cavity or into any
similar part of the other cock might be compared with the
effects of intravenous injection of testis extract of the one on<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
the other. Such parallel investigations would also increase
our knowledge as to the most suitable media and quantities
of the extracts. It is also to be desired, from the theoretical
point of view, that knowledge may be gained as to whether
the internal secretion of the genital glands enters into
chemical union with the protoplasm of the cells or whether
it acts as a physiological stimulus independent of the
quantity supplied. So far we know nothing that would
enable us to come to a definite opinion on this point.</p>

<p>The limited influence of the internal secretions of the
sexual glands in forming the sexual characters must be
realised to warrant the theory of a primary, generally slight,
difference in each cell, but still determinate sexual influence.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
If the existence of distinct graduations of these primary
characteristics in all the cells and tissues can be recognised,
there follow many important and far-reaching conclusions.
The individual egg-cells and spermatozoa may be found to
possess different degrees of maleness and femaleness, not
only in different individuals, but in the ovaries and testes
of the same individual, especially at different times; for
instance, the spermatozoa differ in size and activity. We
are still quite ignorant on these matters, as no one has
worked on the requisite lines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote2"><a href="#FNanchor2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The existence of sexual distinctions before puberty shows that
the power of the internal secretions of the sexual glands does not
account for everything.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is extremely interesting to recall in this connection that
many times different investigators have observed in the
testes of amphibia not only the different stages in the
development of spermatozoa, but mature eggs. This interpretation
of the observations was at first disputed, and it
was suggested that the presence of unusually large cells in
the tubes of the testes had given rise to the error, but the
matter has now been fully confirmed. Moreover, in these
Amphibia, sexually intermediate conditions are very common,
and this should lead us to be careful in making statements
as to the uniform presence of arrhenoplasm or thelyplasm
in a body. The methods of assigning sex to a new-born<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
infant seem most unsatisfactory in the light of these
facts. If the child is observed to possess a male organ, even
although there may be complete epi- or hypo-spadism, or a
double failure of descent of the testes, it is at once described
as a boy and is henceforth treated as one, although in other
parts of the body, for instance in the brain, the sexual
determinant may be much nearer thelyplasm than arrhenoplasm.
The sooner a more exact method of sex discrimination
is insisted upon the better.</p>

<p>As a result of these long inductions and deductions we
may rest assured that all the cells possess a definite primary
sexual determinant which must not be assumed to be alike
or nearly alike throughout the same body. Every cell, every
cell-complex, and every organ have their distinctive indices
on the scale between thelyplasm and arrhenoplasm. For
the exact definition of the sex, an estimation of the indices
over the whole body would be necessary. I should be content
to bear the blame of all the theoretical and practical
errors in this book did I believe myself to have made the
working out of a single case possible.</p>

<p>Differences in the primary sexual determinants, together
with the varying internal secretions (which differ in quantity
and quality in different individuals) produce the phenomena
of sexually intermediate forms. Arrhenoplasm and
thelyplasm, in their countless modifications, are the microscopic
agencies which, in co-operation with the internal
secretions, give rise to the macroscopic differences cited in
the last chapter.</p>

<p>If the correctness of the conclusions so far stated may be
assumed, the necessity is at once evident for a whole series
of anatomical, physiological, histological and histo-chemical
investigations into those differences between male and female
types, in the structure and function of the individual organs
by which the dowers of arrhenoplasm and thelyplasm express
themselves in the tissues. The knowledge we possess at the
present time on these matters comes from the study of
averages, but averages fail to satisfy the modern statistician,
and their scientific value is very small. Investigations into<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
the sex-differences in the weight of the brain, for instance,
have so far proved very little, probably because no care
was taken to choose typical conditions, the assignment of
sex being dependent on baptismal certificates or on superficial
glances at the outward appearance. As if every
&#8220;John&#8221; or &#8220;Mary&#8221; were representative of their sexes
because they had been dubbed &#8220;male&#8221; and &#8220;female!&#8221; It
would have been well, even if exact physiological data were
thought unnecessary, at least to make certain as to a few
facts as to the general condition of the body, which might
serve as guides to the male or female condition, such as, for
instance, the distance between the great trochanters, the iliac
spines, and so forth, for a sexual harmony in the different
parts of the body is certainly more common than great
sexual divergence.</p>

<p>This source of error, the careless acceptance of sexually
intermediate forms as representative subjects for measurement,
has maimed other investigations and seriously retarded
the attainment of genuine and useful results. Those, for
instance, who wish to speculate about the cause of the
superfluity of male births have to reckon with this source of
error. In a special way this carelessness will revenge itself
on those who are investigating the ultimate causes that determine
sex. Until the exact degree of maleness or femaleness
of all the living individuals of the group on which he
is working can be determined, the investigator will have
reason to distrust both his methods and his hypotheses. If
he classify sexually intermediate forms, for instance, according
to their external appearance, as has been done hitherto,
he will come across cases which fuller investigation would
show to be on the wrong side of his results, whilst other
instances, apparently on the wrong side, would right themselves.
Without the conception of an ideal male and an
ideal female, he lacks a standard according to which to
estimate his real cases, and he gropes forward to a superficial
and doubtful conclusion. Maupas, for instance, who
made experiments on the determination of sex in <i>Hydatina
senta</i>, a Rotifer, found that there was always an experimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
error of from three to five per cent. At low temperatures
the production of females was expected, but always about
the above proportion of males appeared; so also at the
higher temperatures a similar proportion of females
appeared. It is probable that this error was due to sexually
intermediate stages, arrhenoplasmic females at the high
temperature, thelyplasmic males at the low temperature.
Where the problem is more complicated, as in the case
of cattle, to say nothing of human beings, the process of
investigation will yield still less harmonious results, and the
correction of the interpretation which will have to be made
by allowing for the disturbance due to the existence of
sexually intermediate forms will be much more difficult.</p>

<p>The study of comparative pathology of the sexual types is
as necessary as their morphology, physiology and development.
In this region of inquiry as elsewhere, statistics
would yield certain results. Diseases manifestly much more
abundant in one sex might be described as peculiar to or
idiopathic of thelyplasm or arrhenoplasm. Myx&#339;dema, for
instance, is idiopathic of the female, hydrocele of the male.</p>

<p>But no statistics, however numerous and accurate, can be
regarded as avoiding a source of theoretical error until it
has been shown from the nature of any particular affection
dealt with that it is in indissoluble, functional relation with
maleness or femaleness. The theory of such associated
diseases must supply a reason why they occur almost exclusively
in the one sex, that is to say, in the phrase of this
treatise, why they are thelyplasmic or arrhenoplasmic.</p>

<p>It has been recognised from time immemorial that, in all
forms of sexually differentiated life, there exists an attraction
between males and females, between the male and
the female, the object of which is procreation. But as the
male and the female are merely abstract conceptions which
never appear in the real world, we cannot speak of sexual
attraction as a simple attempt of the masculine and the
feminine to come together. The theory which I am developing
must take into account all the facts of sexual relations if
it is to be complete; indeed, if it is to be accepted instead of
the older views, it must give a better interpretation of all
these sexual phenomena. My recognition of the fact that M
and F (maleness and femaleness) are distributed in the living
world in every possible proportion has led me to the discovery
of an unknown natural law, of a law not yet suspected
by any philosopher, a law of sexual attraction. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
observations on human beings first led me to my results, I
shall begin with this side of the subject.</p>

<p>Every one possesses a definite, individual taste of his own
with regard to the other sex. If we compare the portrait of
the women which some famous man has been known to
love, we shall nearly always find that they are all closely
alike, the similarity being most obvious in the contour
(more precisely in the &#8220;figure&#8221;) or in the face, but on closer
examination being found to extend to the minutest details,
<i>ad unguem</i>, to the finger-tips. It is precisely the same with
every one else. So, also, every girl who strongly attracts a
man recalls to him the other girls he has loved before.
We see another side of the same phenomenon when we recall
how often we have said of some acquaintance or
another, &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine how that type of woman
pleases him.&#8221; Darwin, in the &#8220;Descent of Man,&#8221; collected
many instances of the existence of this individuality of the
sexual taste amongst animals, and I shall be able to show
that there are analogous phenomena even amongst plants.</p>

<p>Sexual attraction is nearly always, as in the case of gravitation,
reciprocal. Where there appear to be exceptions to
this rule, there is nearly always evidence of the presence of
special influences which have been capable of preventing
the direct action of the special taste, which is almost always
reciprocal, or which have left an unsatisfied craving, if the
direct taste were not allowed its play.</p>

<p>The common saying, &#8220;Waiting for Mr. Right,&#8221; or statements
such as that &#8220;So-and-so are quite unsuitable for
one another,&#8221; show the existence of an obscure presentiment
of the fact that every man or woman possesses certain
individual peculiarities which qualify or disqualify him or
her for marriage with any particular member of the
opposite sex; and that this man cannot be substituted
for that, or this woman for the other without creating a
disharmony.</p>

<p>It is a common personal experience that certain individuals
of the opposite sex are distasteful to us, that others leave us
cold; whilst others again may stimulate us until, at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
some one appears who seems so desirable that everything
in the world is worthless and empty compared with union
with such a one. What are the qualifications of that person?
What are his or her peculiarities? If it really be the
case&mdash;and I think it is&mdash;that every male type has its female
counterpart with regard to sexual affinity, it looks as if there
were some definite law. What is this law? How does it
act? &#8220;Like poles repel, unlike attract,&#8221; was what I was
told when, already armed with my own answer, I resolutely
importuned different kinds of men for a statement, and submitted
instances to their power of generalisation. The
formula, no doubt, is true in a limited sense and for a certain
number of cases. But it is at once too general and too
vague; it would be applied differently by different persons,
and it is incapable of being stated in mathematical terms.</p>

<p>This book does not claim to state all the laws of sexual
affinity, for there are many; nor does it pretend to be able
to tell every one exactly which individual of the opposite
sex will best suit his taste, for that would imply a complete
knowledge of all the laws in question. In this chapter
only one of these laws will be considered&mdash;the law which
stands in organic relation to the rest of the book. I am
working at a number of other laws, but the following is
that to which I have given most investigation, and which
is most elaborated. In criticising this work, allowance must
be made for the incomplete nature of the material consequent
on the novelty and difficulty of the subject.</p>

<p>Fortunately it is not necessary for me to cite at length
either the facts from which I originally derived this law
of sexual affinity or to set out in detail the evidence I
obtained from personal statements. I asked each of those
who helped me, to make out his own case first, and then
to carry out observations in his circle of acquaintances.
I have paid special attention to those cases which have been
noticed and remembered, in which the taste of a friend has
not been understood, or appeared not to be present, or was
different from that of the observer. The minute degree of
knowledge of the external form of the human body which<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
is necessary for the investigation is possessed by every
one.</p>

<p>I have come to the law which I shall now formulate by a
method the validity of which I shall now have to prove.</p>

<p>The law runs as follows: &#8220;For true sexual union it is
necessary that there come together a complete male (M)
and a complete female (F), even although in different cases
the M and F are distributed between the two individuals in
different proportions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The law may be expressed otherwise as follows:</p>

<p>If we take &#956;, any individual regarded in the ordinary way
as a male, and denote his real sexual constitution as M&#956;,
so many parts really male, plus W&#956;, so many parts really
female; if we also take &#969;, any individual regarded in the
ordinary way as a female, and denote <i>her</i> real sexual constitution
as W&#969;, so many parts really female, plus M&#969;, so
many parts really male; then, if there be complete sexual
affinity, the greatest possible sexual attraction between the
two individuals, &#956; and &#969;,</p>

<div class="ideals">

<p>(1) M&#956; (the truly male part in the &#8220;male&#8221;) + M&#969;
(the truly male part in the &#8220;female&#8221;) will equal a constant
quantity, M, the ideal male; and</p>

<p>(2) W&#956; + W&#969; (the ideal female parts in respectively
the &#8220;male&#8221; and the &#8220;female&#8221;) will equal a second
constant quantity, W, the ideal female.</p>

</div><!--ideals-->

<p>This statement must not be misunderstood. Both formulas
refer to one case, to a single sexual relation, the second
following directly from the first and adding nothing to it, as
I set out from the point of view of an individual possessing
just as much femaleness as he lacks of maleness. Were he
completely male, his requisite complement would be a
complete female, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. If, however, he is composed
of a definite inheritance of maleness, and also an
inheritance of femaleness (which must not be neglected),
then, to complete the individual, his maleness must be completed
to make a unit; but so also must his femaleness be
completed.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">There can be no hesitation in admitting the existence of
definite, individual sexual preferences, and such an admission
carries with it approval of the necessity of investigating the
laws of the preference, and its relation to the rest of the
bodily and mental characters of an individual. The law, as
I have stated it, can encounter no initial sense of impossibility,
and is contrary neither to scientific nor common
experience. But it is not self-evident. It might be that the
law, which cannot yet be regarded as fully worked out,
might run as follows:</p>

<div class="formula">

<p class="center">M&#956; - M&#969; = a constant;</p>

</div><!--formula-->

<p class="noindent">that is to say, it may be the difference between the degrees
of masculinity and not the sum of the degrees of masculinity
that is a constant quality, so that the most masculine
man would stand just as far removed from his complement<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
(who in this case would lie nearly midway between masculinity
and femininity) as the most feminine man would be
removed from his complement who would be near the
extreme of femininity. Although, as I have said, this is
conceivable, it is not borne out by experience. Recognising
that we have to do here with an empirical law, and trying
to observe a wise scientific restraint, we shall do well to
avoid speaking as if there were any &#8220;force&#8221; pulling the
two individuals together as if they were puppets; the law is
no more than the statement that an identical relation can
be made out in each case of maximum sexual attraction.
We are dealing, in fact, with what Ostwald termed an
&#8220;invariant&#8221; and Avenarius a &#8220;multiponible&#8221;; and this is
the constant sum formed by the total masculinity and the
total femininity in all cases where a pair of living beings
come together with the maximum sexual attraction.</p>

<p>In this matter we may neglect altogether the so-called
&aelig;sthetic factor, the stimulus of beauty. For does it not
frequently happen that one man is completely captivated by
a particular woman and raves about her beauty, whilst
another, who is not the sexual complement of the woman
in question, cannot imagine what his friend sees in her to
admire. Without discussing the laws of &aelig;sthetics or
attempting to gather together examples of relative values,
it may readily be admitted that a man may consider a
woman beautiful who, from the &aelig;sthetic standpoint, is not
merely indifferent but actually ugly, that in fact pure
&aelig;sthetics deal not with absolute beauty, but merely with
conceptions of beauty from which the sexual factor has
been eliminated.</p>

<p>I have myself worked out the law in, at the lowest, many
hundred cases, and I have found that the exceptions were
only apparent. Almost every couple one meets in the
street furnishes a new proof. The exceptions were specially
instructive, as they not only suggested but led to the investigation
of other laws of sexuality. I myself made special
investigations in the following way. I obtained a set of
photographs of &aelig;sthetically beautiful women of blameless<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
character, each of which was a good example of some
definite proportion of femininity, and I asked a number of
my friends to inspect these and select the most beautiful.
The selection made was invariably that which I had predicted.
With other male friends, who knew on what I was
engaged, I set about in another fashion. They provided
me with photographs from amongst which I was to choose
the one I should expect them to think most beautiful.
Here, too, I was uniformly successful. With others, I was
able to describe most accurately their ideal of the opposite
sex, independently of any suggestions unconsciously given
by them, often in minuter detail than they had realised.
Sometimes, too, I was able to point out to them, for the
first time, the qualities that repelled them in individuals of
the opposite sex, although for the most part men realise
more readily the characters that repel them than the
characters that attract them.</p>

<p>I believe that with a little practice any one could readily
acquire and exercise this art on any circle of friends. A
knowledge of other laws of sexual affinity would be of great
importance. A number of special constants might be taken
as tests of the existence of complementary individuals. For
instance, the law might be caricatured so as to require that
the sum of the length of the hairs of any two perfect lovers
should always be the same. But, as I have already shown
in chapter ii., this result is not to be expected, because
all the organs of the same body do not necessarily possess
the same degree of maleness or femaleness. Such heuristic
rules would soon multiply and bring the whole subject into
ridicule, and I shall therefore abstain from further suggestions
of the kind.</p>

<p>I do not deny that my exposition of the law is somewhat
dogmatical and lacks confirmation by exact detail. But I am
not so anxious to claim finished results as to incite others
to the study, the more so as the means for scientific investigations
are lacking in my own case. But even if much
remains theoretical, I hope that I shall have firmly riveted
the chief beams in my edifice of theory by showing how it<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
explains much that hitherto has found no explanation, and
so shall have, in a fashion, proved it retrospectively by
showing how much it would explain if it were true.</p>

<p>A most remarkable confirmation of my law may be found
in the vegetable kingdom, in a group of facts hitherto
regarded as isolated and to be so strange as to have no
parallel. Every botanist must have guessed already that I
have in mind the phenomena of heterostylism, first discovered
by Persoon, then described by Darwin and named by Hildebrand.
Many Dicotyledons, and a few Monocotyledons, for
instance, species of Primulace&aelig; and Geraneace&aelig; and many
Rubiace&aelig;, phanerogams in the flowers of which both the
pollen and the stigma are functional, although only in cross-fertilisation,
so that the flowers are hermaphrodite in structure
but unisexual physiologically, display the peculiarity
that in different individuals the stamens and the stigma have
different lengths. The individuals, all the flowers of which
have long styles and therefore high stigmas and short
anthers, are, in my judgment, the more female, whilst the
individuals with short styles and long anthers are more male.
In addition to such dimorphic plants, there are also trimorphic
plants, such as <i>Lythrum salicaria</i>, in which the sexual
organs display three forms differing in length. There are
not only long-styled and short-styled forms, but flowers with
styles of a medium length.</p>

<p>Although only dimorphism and trimorphism have been
recognised in the books, these conditions do not exhaust the
actual complexities of structure. Darwin himself pointed
out that if small differences were taken into account, no
less than five different situations of the anthers could be
distinguished. Alongside such plain cases of discontinuity,
of the separation of the different degrees of maleness and
femaleness in plainly distinct individuals, there are also cases
in which the different degrees grade into each other without
breaks in the series. There are analogous cases of discontinuity
in the animal kingdom, although they have always
been thought of as unique and isolated phenomena, as the
parallel with heterostylism had not been suggested. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
several genera of insects, as, for instance, some Earwigs
(<i>Forficul&aelig;</i>) and Lamellicorn Beetles (<i>Lucanus cervus</i>), the
Stag-beetle (<i>Dynastes Hercules</i>), and <i>Xylotrupes gideon</i>, there are
some males in which the antenn&aelig;, the secondary sexual
characters by which they differ most markedly from the
females, are extremely long, and others in which they are
very short. Bateson, who has written most on this subject,
distinguishes the two forms as &#8220;high males&#8221; and &#8220;low
males.&#8221; It is true that a continuous series of intermediate
forms links the extreme types, but, none the less, the vast
majority of the individuals are at one extreme or the other.
Unfortunately, Bateson did not investigate the relations
between these different types of males and the females, and
so it is not known if there be female types with special
sexual affinity for these male types. Thus these observations
can be taken only as a morphological parallel to
heterostylism and not as cases of the law of complementary
sexual attraction.</p>

<p>Heterostylous plants may possibly be the means of establishing
my view that the law of sexual complements holds
good for every kind of living thing. Darwin first, and after
him many other investigators have proved that in heterostylous
plants fertilisation has the best results, or, indeed, may
be possible only when the pollen from a macrostylous flower
(a flower with the shortest form of anthers and longest pistil)
falls on the stigma of a microstylous blossom (one where
the pistil is the shortest possible and the stamens at their
greatest length), or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. In other words, if the
best result is to be attained by the cross-fertilisation of a
pair of flowers, one flower with a long pistil, and therefore
high degree of femaleness, and short stamens must
be mated with another possessing a correspondingly short
pistil, and so, with the amount of femaleness complementary
to the first flower, and with long stamens complementary to
the short stamens of the first flower. In the case of flowers
where there are three pistil lengths, the best results may be
expected when the pollen of one blossom is transmitted to
another blossom in which the stigma is the nearest complement<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
of the stigma of the flower from which the pollen
came; if another combination is made, either naturally or
by artificial fertilisation, then, if a result follows at all, the
seedlings are scanty, dwarfed and sometimes infertile, much
as when hybrids between species are formed.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that the authors who have discussed
heterostylism are not satisfied with the usual explanation,
which is that the insects which visit the flowers carry the
pollen at different relative positions on their bodies corresponding
to the different lengths of the sexual organs and
so produce the wonderful result. Darwin, moreover, admits
that bees carry all sorts of pollen on every part of their
bodies; so that it has still to be made clear how the female
organs dusted with two or three kinds of pollen make their
choice of the most suitable. The supposition of a power of
choice, however interesting and wonderful it is, does not
account for the bad results which follow artificial dusting
with the wrong kind of pollen (so-called &#8220;illegitimate
fertilisation&#8221;). The theory that the stigmas can only
make use of, or are capable of receiving only &#8220;legitimate
pollen&#8221; has been proved by Darwin to be erroneous, inasmuch
as the insects which act as fertilisers certainly sometimes
start various cross-breedings.</p>

<p>The hypothesis that the reason for this selective retention
on the part of individuals is a special quality, deep-seated
in the flowers themselves, seems more probable. We have
probably here to do with the presence, just as in human
beings, of a maximum degree of sexual attraction between
individuals, one of which possesses just as much femaleness as
the other possesses maleness, and this is merely another mode
of stating my sexual law. The probability of this interpretation
is increased by the fact that in the short-styled, long-anthered,
more male flowers, the pollen grains are larger
and the papill&aelig; on the stigmas are smaller than the corresponding
parts of the long-styled, short-anthered, more
female flowers. Here we have certainly to do with different
degrees of maleness and femaleness. These circumstances
supply a strong corroboration of my law of sexual affinity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
that in the vegetable kingdom as well as in the animal
kingdom (I shall return later to this point) fertilisation has
the best results when it occurs between parents with
maximum sexual affinity.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote3"><a href="#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> For special purposes the breeder, whose object frequently is to
modify natural tendencies, will often disregard this law.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Consideration of sexual aversion affords the readiest proof
that the law holds good throughout the animal kingdom. I
should like to suggest here that it would be extremely
interesting to make observations as to whether the larger,
heavier and less active egg-cells exert a special attraction on
the smaller and more active spermatozoa, whilst those egg-cells
with less food-yolk attract more strongly the larger and
less active spermatozoa. It may be the case, as L. Weill
has already suggested in a speculation as to the factors that
determine sex, that there is a correlation between the rates
of motion or kinetic energies of conjugating sexual cells.
It has not yet been determined, although indeed it would
be difficult to determine, if the sexual cells, apart from the
streams and eddies of their fluid medium, approach each
other with equal velocities or sometimes display special
activity. There is a wide field for investigation here.</p>

<p>As I have repeatedly remarked, my law is not the only
law of sexual affinity, otherwise, no doubt, it would have
been discovered long ago. Just because so many other
actors are bound up with it,<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> because another, perhaps
many other laws sometimes overshadow it, cases of undisturbed
action of sexual affinity are rare. As the necessary
investigations have not yet been finished, I will not speak
at length of such laws, but rather by way of illustration I
shall refer to a few factors which as yet cannot be demonstrated
mathematically.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote4"><a href="#FNanchor4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In speaking of the sexual taste in men and women, one thinks
at once of the usual but not invariable preference individuals show
for a particular colour of hair. It would certainly seem as if the
reason for so strongly marked a preference must lie deep in human
nature.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>I shall begin with some phenomena which are pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
generally recognised. Men when quite young, say under
twenty, are attracted by much older women (say those of
thirty-five and so on), whilst men of thirty-five are attracted
by women much younger than themselves. So also, on the
other hand, quite young girls (sweet seventeen) generally
prefer much older men, but, later in life, may marry striplings.
The whole subject deserves close attention and is
both popular and easily noticed.</p>

<p>In spite of the necessary limitation of this work to the
consideration of a single law, it will make for exactness if I
try to state the formula in a more definite fashion, without
the deceptive element of simplicity. Even without being
able to state in definite quantities the other factors and the
co-operating laws, we may reach a satisfactory exactness by
the use of a variable factor.</p>

<p>The first formula was only an abstract general statement
of what is common to all cases of maximum sexual attraction
so far as the sexual relation is governed by the law. I
must now try to find an expression for the strength of the
sexual affinity in any conceivable case, an expression which
on account of its general form, can be used to describe the
relationship between any two living beings, even if these
belong to different species or to the same sex.</p>

whilst K is the variable factor in which we place all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
known and unknown laws of sexual affinity, and which also
varies with the degree of specific, racial and family relationship,
and with the health and absence of deformity in the
two individuals, and which, finally, will become smaller as
the actual spacial distance between the two is greater, and
which can be determined in any individual case.</p>

<p>When in this formula &#945; = &#946; A must be infinity; this is the
extreme case; it is sexual attraction as an elemental force,
as it has been described with a weird mastercraft by
Lynkeus in the novel &#8220;Im Postwagen.&#8221; Such sexual
attraction is as much a natural law as the downward growth
of a rootlet towards the earth, or the migration of bacteria
to the oxygen at the edge of a microscopic cover-glass.
But it takes some time to grow accustomed to such a view.
I shall refer to this point again.</p>

<p>If &#945; - &#946; has its maximum value, which is when it equals
unity, then A = K&nbsp;. <i>f&nbsp;<sup class="form">t</sup></i>.</p>

<p>This would be the extreme case of the action of all the
sympathetic and antipathetic relations between human beings
(leaving out of account social relations in their narrowest
sense, which are merely the safeguards of communities)
which are not included in the law of sexual affinity. As K
generally increases with the strength of congenital relationship,
A has a greater value when the individuals are of the
same nationality than when they belong to different nationalities.
The value of <i>f&nbsp;<sup class="form">t</sup></i> is great in this case, and one can
investigate its fluctuations, as, for instance, when two domestic
animals of different species are in association; at first it
usually stands for violent enmity, or fear of each other (and
A has a negative value), whilst later on a friendship may
come about.</p>

<p>When K = 0 in the formula</p>

<div class="formula">

<p class="center">A = <span class="horsplit"><span class="top bb">K . <i>f&nbsp;<sup class="form">t</sup></i></span>
<span class="bot">&#945; - &#946;</span></span>,</p>

</div><!--formula-->

<p class="noindent">then A = 0, which means that between two living beings
of origin too remote there may be no trace of sexual
attraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span></p>

<p>The provisions of the criminal statute-books, however, in
reference to sodomy and bestiality show plainly that even
in the case of very remote species K has a value greater
than nothing. The formula may apply to two individuals
not only not of the same species, but even not of the same
order.</p>

<p>It is a new theory that the union of male and female
organisms is no mere matter of chance, but is guided by a
definite law; and the actual complexities which I have
merely suggested show the need for complete investigation
into the mysterious nature of sexual attraction.</p>

<p>The experiments of Wilhelm Pfeffer have shown that the
male cells of many cryptogams are naturally attracted not
merely by the female cells, but also by substances which they
have come in contact with under natural conditions, or which
have been introduced to them experimentally, in the latter
case the substances being sometimes of a kind with which
they could not possibly have come in contact, except under
the conditions of experiment. Thus the male cells of ferns
are attracted not only by the malic acid secreted naturally
by the archegonia, but by synthetically prepared malic acid,
whilst the male cells of mosses are attracted either by the
natural acid of the female cells or by acid prepared from
cane sugar. A male cell, which, we know not how, is
influenced by the degree of concentration of a solution,
moves towards the most concentrated part of the fluid.
Pfeffer named such movements &#8220;chemotactic&#8221; and coined
the word &#8220;chemotropism&#8221; to include these and many other
asexual cases of motion stimulated by chemical bodies.
There is much to support the view that the attraction
exercised by females on males which perceive them at a
distance by sense organs is to be regarded as analogous
in certain respects with chemotropism.</p>

<p>It seems highly probable that chemotropism is also the
explanation of the restless and persistent energy with which
for days together the mammalian spermatozoa seek the
entrance to the uterus, although the natural current produced
from the mucous membrane of the uterus is from<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
within outwards. The spermatozoon, in spite of all mechanical
and other hindrances, makes for the egg-cell with
an almost incredible certainty. In this connection we may
call to mind the prodigious journeys made by many fish;
salmon travel for months together, practically without taking
any food, from the open sea to the sources of the Rhine,
against the current of the river, in order to spawn in localities
that are safe and well provided with food.</p>

<p>I have recently been looking at the beautiful sketches
which P. Falkenberg has made of the processes of fertilisation
in some of the Mediterranean seaweeds. When we
speak of the lines of force between the opposite poles of
magnets we are dealing with a force no more natural than
that which irresistibly attracts the spermatozoon and the
egg-cell. The chief difference seems to be that in the case
of the attraction between the inorganic substances, strains
are set up in the media between the two poles, whilst in the
living matter the forces seem confined to the organisms
themselves. According to Falkenberg&#8217;s observations, the
spermatozoa, in moving towards the egg-cells, are able to
overcome the force which otherwise would be exercised
upon them by a source of light. The sexual attraction,
the chemotactic force, is stronger than the phototactic
force.</p>

<p>When a union has taken place between two individuals
who, according to my formula, are not adapted to each
other, if later, the natural complement of either appears
the inclination to desert the makeshift at once asserts itself
in accordance with an inevitable law of nature. A divorce
takes place, as much constitutional, depending on the nature
of things, as when, if iron sulphate and caustic potash are
brought together, the SO<sub>4</sub> ions leave the iron to unite with
the potassium. When in nature an adjustment of such
differences of potential is about to take place, he who would
approve or disapprove of the process from the moral point
of view would appear to most to play a ridiculous part.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental idea in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Wahlverwandtschaften&#8221;
(Elective Affinities), and in the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
chapter of the first part of that work he makes it the
subject of a playful introduction which was full of undreamed
of future significance, and the full force of which
he was fated himself to experience in later life. I must confess
to being proud that this book is the first work to take up
his ideas. None the less, it is as little my intention as it was
the intention of Goethe to advocate divorce; I hope only
to explain it. There are human motives which indispose
man to divorce and enable him to withstand it. This I shall
discuss later on. The physical side of sex in man is less
completely ruled by natural law than is the case with lower
animals. We get an indication of this in the fact that man
is sexual throughout the year, and that in him there is less
trace than even in domestic animals of the existence of a
special spring breeding-season.</p>

<p>The law of sexual affinity is analogous in another respect
to a well-known law of theoretical chemistry, although,
indeed, there are marked differences. The violence of a
chemical reaction is proportionate to the mass of the substances
involved, as, for instance, a stronger acid solution
unites with a stronger basic solution with greater avidity,
just as in the case of the union of a pair of living beings
with strong maleness and femaleness. But there is an
essential difference between the living process and the
reaction of the lifeless chemical substances. The living
organism is not homogeneous and isotropic in its composition;
it is not divisible into a number of small parts
of identical properties. The difference depends on the
principle of individuality, on the fact that every living
thing is an individual, and that its individuality is essentially
structural. And so in the vital process it is not as in
inorganic chemistry; there is no possibility of a larger proportion
forming one compound, a smaller proportion forming
another. The organic chemotropism, moreover, may
be negative. In certain cases the value of A may result in
a negative quantity, that is to say, the sexual attraction may
appear in the form of sexual repulsion. It is true that in
purely chemical processes the same reaction may take place<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
at different rates. Taking, however, the total failure of some
reaction by catalytic interference as the equivalent of a
sexual repulsion, it never happens, according to the latest
investigations at least, that the interference merely induces
the reaction after a longer or shorter interval. On the other
hand, it happens frequently that a compound which is
formed at one temperature breaks up at another temperature.
Here the &#8220;direction&#8221; of the reaction is a function of
the temperature, as, in the vital process, it may be a function
of time.</p>

<p>In the value of the factor &#8220;<i>t</i>,&#8221; the time of reaction, a
final analogy of sexual attraction with chemical processes
may be found, if we are willing to trace the comparison
without laying too much stress upon it. Consider the
formula for the rapidity of the reaction, the different
degrees of rapidity with which a sexual attraction between
two individuals is established, and reflect how the value of
&#8220;A&#8221; varies with the value of &#8220;<i>t</i>.&#8221; However, what Kant
termed mathematical vanity must not tempt us to read
into our equations complicated and difficult processes, the
validity of which is uncertain. All that can be implied is
simple enough; sensual desire increases with the time
during which two individuals are in propinquity; if they
were shut up together, it would develop if there were no
repulsion, or practically no repulsion between them, in the
fashion of some slow chemical process which takes much
time before its result is visible. Such a case is the confidence
with which it is said of a marriage arranged without
love, &#8220;Love will come later; time will bring it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is plain that too much stress must not be laid on the
analogy between sexual affinity and purely chemical processes.
None the less, I thought it illuminating to make the
comparison. It is not yet quite clear if the sexual attraction
is to be ranked with the &#8220;tropisms,&#8221; and the matter
cannot be settled without going beyond mere sexuality to
discuss the general problem of erotics. The phenomena
of love require a different treatment, and I shall return to
them in the second part of this book. None the less, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
are analogies that cannot be denied when human attractions
and chemotropism are compared. I may refer as an instance
to the relation between Edward and Ottilie in Goethe&#8217;s
&#8220;Wahlverwandtschaften.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mention of Goethe&#8217;s romance leads naturally to a discussion
of the marriage problem, and I may here give a few
of the practical inferences which would seem to follow
from the theoretical considerations of this chapter. It is
clear that a natural law, not dissimilar to other natural laws,
exists with regard to sexual attraction; this law shows that,
whilst innumerable gradations of sexuality exist, there always
may be found pairs of beings the members of which are
almost perfectly adapted to one another. So far, marriage
has its justification, and, from the standpoint of biology,
free love is condemned. Monogamy, however, is a more
difficult problem, the solution of which involves other considerations,
such as periodicity, to which I shall refer later,
and the change of the sexual taste with advancing years.</p>

<p>A second conclusion may be derived from heterostylism,
especially with reference to the fact that &#8220;illegitimate fertilisation&#8221;
almost invariably produces less fertile offspring.
This leads to the consideration that amongst other forms of
life the strongest and healthiest offspring will result from
unions in which there is the maximum of sexual suitability.
As the old saying has it, &#8220;love-children&#8221; turn out to be the
finest, strongest, and most vigorous of human beings. Those
who are interested in the improvement of mankind must
therefore, on purely hygienic grounds, oppose the ordinary
mercenary marriages of convenience.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the law of sexual attraction
may yield useful results when applied to the breeding of
animals. More attention will have to be given to the
secondary sexual characters of the animals which it is
proposed to mate. The artificial methods made use of to
secure the serving of mares by stallions unattractive to them
do not always fail, but are followed by indifferent results.
Probably an obvious result of the use of a substituted
stallion in impregnating a mare is the extreme nervousness<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
of the progeny, which must be treated with bromide and
other drugs. So, also, the degeneration of modern Jews
may be traced in part to the fact that amongst them
marriages for other reasons than love are specially
common.</p>

<p>Amongst the many fundamental principles established by
the careful observations and experiments of Darwin, and
since confirmed by other investigators, is the fact that both
very closely related individuals, and those whose specific
characters are too unlike, have little sexual attraction for
each other, and that if in spite of this sexual union occurs,
the offspring usually die at an early stage or are very feeble,
or are practically infertile. So also, in heterostylous plants
&#8220;legitimate fertilisation&#8221; brings about more numerous and
vigorous seeds than come from other unions.</p>

<p>It may be said in general that the offspring of those
parents which showed the greatest sexual attraction succeed
best.</p>

<p>This rule, which is certainly universal, implies the correctness
of a conclusion which might be drawn from the earlier
part of this book. When a marriage has taken place and
children have been produced, these have gained nothing
from the conquest of sexual repulsion by the parents, for
such a conquest could not take place without damage to the
mental and bodily characters of the children that would
come of it. It is certain, however, that many childless
marriages have been loveless marriages. The old idea that
the chance of conception is increased where there is a
mutual participation in the sexual act is closely connected
with what we have been considering as to the greater
intensity of the sexual attraction between two complementary
individuals.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
HOMO-SEXUALITY AND PEDERASTY</h3>

<p>The law of Sexual Attraction gives the long-sought-for
explanation of sexual inversion, of sexual inclination
towards members of the same sex, whether or no that be
accompanied by aversion from members of the opposite sex.
Without reference to a distinction which I shall deal with
later on, I may say at once that it is exceedingly probable
that, in all cases of sexual inversion, there will be found
indications of the anatomical characters of the other sex.
There is no such thing as a genuine &#8220;psycho-sexual hermaphroditism&#8221;;
the men who are sexually attracted by
men have outward marks of effeminacy, just as women of a
similar disposition to those of their own sex exhibit male
characters. That this should be so is quite intelligible if we
admit the close parallelism between body and mind, and
further light is thrown upon it by the facts explained in the
second chapter of this book; the facts as to the male or
female principle not being uniformly present all over the
same body, but distributed in different amounts in different
organs. In all cases of sexual inversion, there is invariably
an anatomical approximation to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Such a view is directly opposed to that of those who
would maintain that sexual inversion is an acquired
character, and one that has superseded normal sexual
impulses. Schrenk-Notzing, Kraepelin, and F&eacute;r&eacute; are
amongst those writers who have urged the view that sexual
inversion is an acquired habit, the result of abstinence from
normal intercourse and particularly induced by example.
But what about the first offender? Did the god Hermaphroditos<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
teach him? It might equally be sought to prove
that the sexual inclination of a normal man for a normal
woman was an unnatural, acquired habit&mdash;a habit, as some
ancient writers have suggested, that arose from some accidental
discovery of its agreeable nature. Just as a normal
man discovers for himself what a woman is, so also, in the
case of a sexual &#8220;invert&#8221; the attraction exercised on him
by a person of his own sex is a normal product of his
development from his birth. Naturally the opportunity
must come in which the individual may put in practice his
desire for inverted sexuality, but the opportunity will be
taken only when his natural constitution has made the individual
ready for it. That sexual abstinence (to take the
second supposed cause of inversion) should result in anything
more than masturbation may be explained by the
supposition that inversion is acquired, but that it should be
coveted and eagerly sought can only happen when the
demand for it is rooted in the constitution. In the same
fashion normal sexual attraction might be said to be an
acquired character, if it could be proved definitely that, to
fall in love, a normal man must first see a woman or a
picture of a woman. Those who assert that sexual inversion
is an acquired character, are making a merely incidental or
accessory factor responsible for the whole constitution of
an organism.</p>

<p>There is little reason for saying that sexual inversion is
acquired, and there is just as little for regarding it as inherited
from parents or grandparents. Such an assertion,
it is true, has not been made, and seems contrary to all
experience; but it has been suggested that it is due to a
neuropathic diathesis, and that general constitutional weakness
is to be found in the descendants of those who have
displayed sexual inversion. In fact sexual inversion has
usually been regarded as psycho-pathological, as a symptom
of degeneration, and those who exhibit it have been considered
as physically unfit. This view, however, is falling
into disrepute, especially as Krafft-Ebing, its principal
champion, abandoned it in the later editions of his work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
None the less, it is not generally recognised that sexual
inverts may be otherwise perfectly healthy, and with regard
to other social matters quite normal. When they have been
asked if they would have wished matters to be different
with them in this respect, almost invariably they answer in
the negative.</p>

<p>It is due to the erroneous conceptions that I have mentioned
that homo-sexuality has not been considered in
relation with other facts. Let those who regard sexual
inversion as pathological, as a hideous anomaly of mental
development (the view accepted by the populace), or believe
it to be an acquired vice, the result of an execrable seduction,
remember that there exist all transitional stages
reaching from the most masculine male to the most
effeminate male and so on to the sexual invert, the false
and true hermaphrodite; and then, on the other side, successively
through the sapphist to the virago and so on until
the most feminine virgin is reached. In the interpretation
of this volume, sexual inverts of both sexes are to be defined
as individuals in whom the factor &#945; (see <a href="#Page8">page 8</a>, chap. i.)
is very nearly 0.5 and so is practically equal to &#945;&acute;; in other
words, individuals in whom there is as much maleness as
femaleness, or indeed who, although reckoned as men, may
contain an excess of femaleness, or as women and yet be
more male than female. Because of the want of uniformity
in the sexual characters of the body, it is fairly certain that
many individuals have their sex assigned them on account
of the existence of the primary male sexual characteristic,
even although there may be delayed <i>descensus testiculorum</i>, or
epi- or hypo-spadism, or, later on, absence of active spermatozoa,
or even, in the case of assignment of the female sex,
absence of the vagina, and thus male avocations (such as
compulsory military service) may come to be assigned to
those in whom &#945; is less than 0.5 and &#945;&acute; greater than 0.5.
The sexual complement of such individuals really is to be
found on their own side of the sexual line, that is to say, on
the side on which they are reckoned, although in reality
they may belong to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, and this not only supports my view but can be
explained only by it, there are no inverts who are completely
sexually inverted. In all of them there is from the beginning
an inclination to both sexes; they are, in fact, bisexual.
It may be that later on they may actively encourage a slight
leaning towards one sex or the other, and so become
practically unisexual either in the normal or in the inverted
sense, or surrounding influence may bring about this result
for them. But in such processes the fundamental bisexuality
is never obliterated and may at any time give evidence of
its suppressed presence.</p>

<p>Reference has often been made, and in recent years has
increasingly been made, to the relation between homo-sexuality
and the presence of bisexual rudiments in the
embryonic stages of animals and plants. What is new in
my view is that according to it, homo-sexuality cannot be
regarded as an atavism or as due to arrested embryonic
development, or incomplete differentiation of sex; it cannot
be regarded as an anomaly of rare occurrence interpolating
itself in customary complete separation of the sexes.
Homo-sexuality is merely the sexual condition of these
intermediate sexual forms that stretch from one ideally
sexual condition to the other sexual condition. In my view
all actual organisms have both homo-sexuality and hetero-sexuality.</p>

<p>That the rudiment of homo-sexuality, in however weak a
form, exists in every human being, corresponding to the
greater or smaller development of the characters of the
opposite sex, is proved conclusively from the fact that in
the adolescent stage, while there is still a considerable
amount of undifferentiated sexuality, and before the internal
secretions have exerted their stimulating force, passionate
attachments with a sensual side are the rule amongst boys
as well as amongst girls.</p>

<p>A person who retains from that age onwards a marked
tendency to &#8220;friendship&#8221; with a person of his own sex
must have a strong taint of the other sex in him. Those,
however, are still more obviously intermediate sexual forms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
who, after association with both sexes, fail to have aroused
in them the normal passion for the opposite sex, but still
endeavour to maintain confidential, devoted affection with
those of their own sex.</p>

<p>There is no friendship between men that has not an element
of sexuality in it, however little accentuated it may be
in the nature of the friendship, and however painful the
idea of the sexual element would be. But it is enough to
remember that there can be no friendship unless there has
been some attraction to draw the men together. Much of
the affection, protection, and nepotism between men is due
to the presence of unsuspected sexual compatibility.</p>

<p>An analogy with the sexual friendship of youth may be
traced in the case of old men, when, for instance, with the
involution following old age, the latent amphisexuality of
man appears. This may be the reason why so many men
of fifty years and upwards are guilty of indecency.</p>

<p>Homo-sexuality has been observed amongst animals to
a considerable extent. F. Karsch has made a wide, if not
complete, compilation from other authors. Unfortunately,
practically no observations were made as to the grades of
maleness or femaleness to be observed in such cases. But
we may be reasonably certain that the law holds good in
the animal world. If bulls are kept apart from cows for a
considerable time, homo-sexual acts occur amongst them; the
most female are the first to become corrupted, the others
later, some perhaps never. (It is amongst cattle that the
greatest number of sexually intermediate forms have been
recorded.) This shows that the tendency was latent in
them, but that at other times the sexual demand was satisfied
in normal fashion. Cattle in captivity behave precisely
as prisoners and convicts in these matters. Animals exhibit
not merely onanism (which is known to them as to human
beings), but also homo-sexuality; and this fact, together
with the fact that sexually intermediate forms are known to
occur amongst them, I regard as strong evidence for my
law of sexual attraction.</p>

<p>Inverted sexual attraction, then, is no exception to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
law of sexual attraction, but is merely a special case of
it. An individual who is half-man, half-woman, requires as
sexual complement a being similarly equipped with a share
of both sexes in order to fulfil the requirements of the law.
This explains the fact that sexual inverts usually associate
only with persons of similar character, and rarely admit to
intimacy those who are normal. The sexual attraction is
mutual, and this explains why sexual inverts so readily
recognise each other. This being so, the normal element
in human society has very little idea of the extent to which
homo-sexuality is practised, and when a case becomes public
property, every normal young profligate thinks that he has
a right to condemn such &#8220;atrocities.&#8221; So recently as the
year 1900 a professor of psychiatry in a German university
urged that those who practised homo-sexuality should be
castrated.</p>

<p>The therapeutical remedies which have been used to
combat homo-sexuality, in cases where such treatment has
been attempted, are certainly less radical than the advice of
the professor; but they serve to show only how little the
nature of homo-sexuality was understood. The method used
at present is hypnotism, and this can rest only on the theory
that homo-sexuality is an acquired character. By suggesting
the idea of the female form and of normal congress, it is
sought to accustom those under treatment to normal relations.
But the acknowledged results are very few.</p>

<p>The failure is to be expected from our standpoint. The
hypnotiser suggests to the subject the image of a &#8220;typical&#8221;
woman, ignorant of the innate differences in the subject
and unaware that such a type is naturally repulsive to him.
And as the normal typical woman is not his complement, it
is fruitless of the doctor to advise the services of any casual
Venus, however attractive, to complete the cure of a man
who has long shunned normal intercourse. If our formula
were used to discover the complement of the male invert, it
would point to the most man-like woman, the Lesbian or
Sapphist type. Probably such is the only type of woman
who would attract the sexual invert or please him. If a<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
cure for sexual inversion must be sought because it cannot
be left to its own extinction, then this theory offers the
following solution. Sexual inverts must be brought to
sexual inverts, from homo-sexualists to Sapphists, each in
their grades. Knowledge of such a solution should lead to
repeal of the ridiculous laws of England, Germany and
Austria directed against homo-sexuality, so far at least as
to make the punishments the lightest possible. In the
second part of this book it will be made clear why both the
active and the passive parts in male homo-sexuality appear
disgraceful, although the desire is greater than in the case
of the normal relation of a man and woman. In the abstract
there is no ethical difference between the two.</p>

<p>In spite of all the present-day clamour about the existence
of different rights for different individualities, there is only
one law that governs mankind, just as there is only one
logic and not several logics. It is in opposition to that law,
as well as to the theory of punishment according to which
the legal offence, not the moral offence, is punished, that
we forbid the homo-sexualist to carry on his practices whilst
we allow the hetero-sexualist full play, so long as both avoid
open scandal. Speaking from the standpoint of a purer
state of humanity and of a criminal law untainted by the
pedagogic idea of punishment as a deterrent, the only
logical and rational method of treatment for sexual inverts
would be to allow them to seek and obtain what they
require where they can, that is to say, amongst other
inverts.</p>

<p>My theory appears to me quite incontrovertible and conclusive,
and to afford a complete explanation of the entire
set of phenomena. The exposition, however, must now
face a set of facts which appear quite opposed to it, and
which seem absolutely to contradict my reference of sexual
inversion to the existence of sexually intermediate types,
and my explanation of the law governing the attraction of
these types for each other. It is probably the case that my
explanation is sufficient for all female sexual inverts, but it
is certainly true that there are men with very little taint of<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
femaleness about them who yet exert a very strong influence
on members of their own sex, a stronger influence
than that of other men who may have more femaleness&mdash;an
influence which can be exerted even on very male
men, and an influence which, finally, often appears to be
much greater than the influence any woman can exert on
these men. Albert Moll is justified in saying as follows:
&#8220;There exist psycho-sexual hermaphrodites who are attracted
by members of both sexes, but who in the case of
each sex appear to care only for the characters peculiar to
that sex; and, on the other hand, there are also psycho-sexual
(?) hermaphrodites who, in the case of each sex, are
attracted, not by the characteristics peculiar to that sex,
but by those which are either sexually indifferent or even
antagonistic to the sex in question.&#8221; Upon this distinction
depends the difference between the two sets of phenomena
indicated in the title of this chapter&mdash;Homo-sexuality and
Pederasty. The distinction may be expressed as follows:
The homo-sexualist is that type of sexual invert who prefers
very female men or very male women, in accordance with
the general law of sexual attraction. The pederast, on the
other hand, may be attracted either by very male men or by
very female women, but in the latter case only in so far
as he is not pederastic. Moreover, his inclination for the
male sex is stronger than for the female sex, and is more
deeply seated in his nature. The origin of pederasty is
a problem in itself and remains unsolved by this investigation.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER V</span><br />
THE SCIENCE OF CHARACTER AND THE
SCIENCE OF FORM</h3>

<p>In view of the admitted close correspondence between
matter and mind, we may expect to find that the conception
of sexually intermediate forms, if applied to mental facts,
will yield a rich crop of results. The existence of a female
mental type and a male mental type can readily be imagined
(and the quest of these types has been made by many
investigators), but such perfect types never occur as actual
individuals, simply because in the mind, as in the body, all
sorts of sexually intermediate conditions exist. My conception
will also be of great service in helping us to discriminate
between the different mental qualities, and to throw some
light into what has always been a dark corner for psychologists&mdash;the
differences between different individuals. A great
step will be made if we are able to supply graded categories
for the mental diathesis of individuals; if it shall cease to
be scientific to say that the character of an individual is
merely male or female; but if we can make a measured
judgment and say that such and such an one is so many
parts male and so many parts female. Which element in
any particular individual has done, said, or thought this or
the other? By making the answer to such a question possible,
we shall have done much towards the definite description
of the individual, and the new method will determine
the direction of future investigation. The knowledge of the
past, which set out from conceptions which were really
confused averages, has been equally far from reaching the
broadest truths as from searching out the most intimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
detailed knowledge. This failure of past methods gives us
hope that the principle of sexually intermediate forms may
serve as the foundation of a scientific study of character
and justifies the attempt to make of it an illuminating
principle for the psychology of individual differences. Its
application to the science of character, which, so far, has
been in the hands of merely literary authors, and is from
the scientific point of view an untouched field, is to be
greeted more warmly as it is capable of being used quantitatively,
so that we venture to estimate the percentage of
maleness and femaleness which an individual possesses
even in the mental qualities. The answer to this question
is not given even if we know the exact anatomical position
of an organism on the scale stretching from male to female,
although as a matter of fact congruity between bodily and
mental sexuality is more common than incongruity. But
we must remember what was stated in chap. ii. as to the
uneven distribution of sexuality over the body.</p>

<p>The proportion of the male to the female principle in the
same human being must not be assumed to be a constant
quantity. An important new conclusion must be taken
into account, a conclusion which is necessary to the right
application of the principle which clears up in a striking
fashion earlier psychological work. The fact is that every
human being varies or oscillates between the maleness and
the femaleness of his constitution. In some cases these
oscillations are abnormally large, in other cases so small as
to escape observation, but they are always present, and
when they are great they may even reveal themselves in
the outward aspect of the body. Like the variations in the
magnetism of the earth, these sexual oscillations are either
regular or irregular. The regular forms are sometimes
minute; for instance, many men feel more male at night.
The large and regular oscillations correspond to the great
divisions of organic life to which attention is only now
being directed, and they may throw light upon many
puzzling phenomena. The irregular oscillations probably
depend chiefly upon the environment, as for instance on<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
the sexuality of surrounding human beings. They may
help to explain some curious points in the psychology of a
crowd which have not yet received sufficient attention.</p>

<p>In short, bi-sexuality cannot be properly observed in a
single moment, but must be studied through successive
periods of time. This time-element in psychological differences
of sexuality may be regularly periodic or not. The
swing towards one pole of sexuality may be greater than
the following swing to the other side. Although theoretically
possible, it seems to be extremely rare for the swing
to the male side to be exactly equal to the swing towards
the female side.</p>

<p>It may be admitted in principle, before proceeding to
detailed investigation, that the conception of sexually intermediate
forms makes possible a more accurate description
of individual characters in so far as it aids in determining
the proportion of male and female in each individual, and
of measuring the oscillations to each side of which any
individual is capable. A point of method must be decided
at once, as upon it depends the course the investigation
will pursue. Are we to begin by an empirical investigation
of the almost innumerable intermediate conditions in
mental sexuality, or are we to set out with the abstract sexual
types, the ideal psychological man and woman, and then investigate
deductively how far such ideal pictures correspond
with concrete cases? The former method is that which the
development of psychological knowledge has pursued; ideals
have been derived from facts, sexual types constructed from
observation of the manifold complexity of nature; it would
be inductive and analytic. The latter mode, deductive and
synthetic, is more in accordance with formal logic.</p>

<p>I have been unwilling to pursue the second method as
fully as is possible, because every one can apply for himself
to concrete facts the two well-defined extreme types; once
it is understood that actual individuals are mixtures of the
types, it is simple to apply theory to practice, and the actual
pursuit of detailed cases would involve much repetition and
bring little theoretical advantage. The second method,<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
however, is impracticable. The collection of the long series
of details from which the inductions would be made would
simply weary the reader.</p>

<p>In the first or biological part of my work, I give little
attention to the extreme types, but devote myself to the
fullest investigation of the intermediate stages. In the
second part, I shall endeavour to make as full a psychological
analysis as possible of the characters of the male
and female types, and will touch only lightly on concrete
instances.</p>

<p>I shall first mention, without laying too much stress on
them, some of the more obvious mental characteristics of
the intermediate conditions.</p>

<p>Womanish men are usually extremely anxious to marry,
at least (I mention this to prevent misconception) if a
sufficiently brilliant opportunity offers itself. When it is
possible, they nearly always marry whilst they are still quite
young. It is especially gratifying to them to get as wives
famous women, artists or poets, or singers and actresses.</p>

<p>Womanish men are physically lazier than other men in
proportion to the degree of their womanishness. There are
&#8220;men&#8221; who go out walking with the sole object of displaying
their faces like the faces of women, hoping that they
will be admired, after which they return contentedly home.
The ancient &#8220;Narcissus&#8221; was a prototype of such persons.
These people are naturally fastidious about the dressing of
their hair, their apparel, shoes, and linen; they are concerned
as to their personal appearance at all times, and
about the minutest details of their toilet. They are conscious
of every glance thrown on them by other men, and
because of the female element in them, they are coquettish
in gait and demeanour. Viragoes, on the other hand, frequently
are careless about their toilet, and even about the
personal care of their bodies; they take less time in dressing
than many womanish men. The dandyism of men on the
one hand, and much of what is called the emancipation of
women, are due to the increase in the numbers of these
epicene creatures, and not merely to a passing fashion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span></p>

<p>Indeed, if one inquires why anything becomes the fashion
it will be found that there is a true cause for it.</p>

<p>The more femaleness a woman possesses the less will she
understand a man, and the sexual characters of a man will
have the greater influence on her. This is more than a
mere application of the law of sexual attraction, as I have
already stated it. So also the more manly a man is the less
will he understand women, but the more readily be influenced
by them as women. Those men who claim to
understand women are themselves very nearly women.
Womanish men often know how to treat women much
better than manly men. Manly men, except in most rare
cases, learn how to deal with women only after long experience,
and even then most imperfectly.</p>

<p>Although I have been touching here in a most superficial
way on what are no more than tertiary sexual characters, I
wish to point out an application of my conclusions to pedagogy.
I am convinced that the more these views are
understood the more certainly will they lead to an individual
treatment in education. At the present time shoemakers,
who make shoes to measure, deal more rationally
with individuals than our teachers and schoolmasters in
their application of moral principles. At present the
sexually intermediate forms of individuals (especially on
the female side) are treated exactly as if they were good
examples of the ideal male or female types. There is
wanted an &#8220;orthop&aelig;dic&#8221; treatment of the soul instead of
the torture caused by the application of ready-made conventional
shapes. The present system stamps out much
that is original, uproots much that is truly natural, and
distorts much into artificial and unnatural forms.</p>

<p>From time immemorial there have been only two systems
of education; one for those who come into the world designated
by one set of characters as males, and another for
those who are similarly assumed to be females. Almost at
once the &#8220;boys&#8221; and the &#8220;girls&#8221; are dressed differently,
learn to play different games, go through different courses
of instruction, the girls being put to stitching and so forth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
The intermediate individuals are placed at a great disadvantage.
And yet the instincts natural to their condition
reveal themselves quickly enough, often even before puberty.
There are boys who like to play with dolls, who learn to
knit and sew with their sisters, and who are pleased to be
given girls&#8217; names. There are girls who delight in the
noisier sports of their brothers, and who make chums and
playmates of them. After puberty, there is a still stronger
display of the innate differences. Manlike women wear their
hair short, affect manly dress, study, drink, smoke, are fond of
mountaineering, or devote themselves passionately to sport.
Womanish men grow their hair long, wear corsets, are
experts in the toilet devices of women, and show the
greatest readiness to become friendly and intimate with
them, preferring their society to that of men.</p>

<p>Later on, the different laws and customs to which the so-called
sexes are subjected press them as by a vice into
distinctive moulds. The proposals which should follow
from my conclusions will encounter more passive resistance,
I fear, in the case of girls than in that of boys. I
must here contradict, in the most positive fashion, a dogma
that is authoritatively and widely maintained at the present
time, the idea that all women are alike, that no individuals
exist amongst women. It is true that amongst those individuals
whose constitutions lie nearer the female side than
the male side, the differences and possibilities are not so
great as amongst those on the male side; the greater variability
of males is true not only for the human race but for
the living world, and is related to the principles established
by Darwin. None the less, there are plenty of differences
amongst women. The psychological origin of this common
error depends chiefly on a fact that I explained in chap. iii.,
the fact that every man in his life becomes intimate only
with a group of women defined by his own constitution,
and so naturally he finds them much alike. For the
same reason, and in the same way, one may often hear a
woman say that all men are alike. And the narrow uniform
view about men, displayed by most of the leaders of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
women&#8217;s rights movement depends on precisely the same
cause.</p>

<p>It is clear that the principle of the existence of innumerable
individual proportions of the male and female
principles is a basis of the study of character which must
be applied in any rational scheme of pedagogy.</p>

<p>The science of character must be associated with some
form of psychology that takes into account some theory of
the real existence of mental phenomena in the same fashion
that anatomy is related to physiology. And so it is necessary,
quite apart from theoretical reasons, to attempt to pursue a
psychology of individual differences. This attempt will be
readily enough followed by those who believe in the parallelism
between mind and matter, for they will see in psychology
no more than the physiology of the central nervous
system, and will readily admit that the science of character
must be a sister of morphology. As a matter of fact
there is great hope that in future characterology and morphology
will each greatly help the other. The principle of
sexually intermediate forms, and still more the parallelism
between characterology and morphology in the widest
application, make us look forward to the time when physiognomy
will take its honourable place amongst the
sciences, a place which so many have attempted to gain
for it but as yet unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>The problem of physiognomy is the problem of the relation
between the static mental forces and the static bodily
forces, just as the problem of physiological psychology
deals with the dynamic aspect of the same relations. It is
a great error in method, and in fact, to treat the study of
physiognomy, because of its difficulty, as impracticable.
And yet this is the attitude of contemporary scientific
circles, unconsciously perhaps rather than consciously,
but occasionally becoming obvious as for instance in
the case of the attempt of von M&ouml;bius to pursue the
work of Gall with regard to the physiognomy of those with
a natural aptitude for mathematics. If it be possible, and
many have shown that it is possible, to judge correctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
much of the character of an individual merely from the
examination of his external appearance, without the aid of
cross-examination or guessing, it cannot be impossible to
reduce such modes of observation to an exact method. There
is little more required than an exact study of the expression
of the characteristic emotions and the tracking (to use a
rough analogy) of the routes of the cables passing to the
speech centres.</p>

<p>None the less it will be long before official science
ceases to regard the study of physiognomy as illegitimate.
Although people will still believe in the parallelism of mind
and body, they will continue to treat the physiognomist as
as much of a charlatan as until quite recently the hypnotist
was thought to be. None the less, all mankind at least
unconsciously, and intelligent persons consciously, will
continue to be physiognomists, people will continue to
judge character from the nose, although they will not admit
the existence of a science of physiognomy, and the portraits
of celebrated men and of murderers will continue to interest
every one.</p>

<p>I am inclined to believe that the assumption of a universally
acquired correspondence between mind and body may
be a hitherto neglected fundamental function of our mind.
It is certainly the case that every one believes in physiognomy
and actually practises it. The principle of the existence
of a definite relation between mind and body must be
accepted as an illuminating axiom for psychological research,
and it will be for religion and metaphysics to work out
the details of a relationship which must be accepted as
existing.</p>

<p>Whether or no the science of character can be linked with
morphology, it will be valuable not only to these sciences
but to physiognomy if we can penetrate a little deeper into
the confusion that now reigns in order to find if wrong
methods have not been responsible for it. I hope that
the attempt I am about to make will lead some little
way into the labyrinth, and will prove to be of general
application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<p>Some men are fond of dogs and detest cats; others are
devoted to cats and dislike dogs. Inquiring minds have
delighted to ask in such cases, Why are cats attractive to
one person, dogs to another? Why?</p>

<p>I do not think that this is the most fruitful way of stating
the problem. I believe it to be more important to ask in
what other respects lovers of dogs and of cats differ from
one another. The habit, where one difference has been
detected, of seeking for the associated differences, will
prove extremely useful not only to pure morphology and to
the science of character, but ultimately to physiognomy, the
meeting-point of the two sciences. Aristotle pointed out
long ago that many characteristics of animals do not vary
independently of each other. Later on Cuvier, in particular,
but also Geoffrey St. Hilaire and Darwin made a
special study of these &#8220;correlations.&#8221; Occasionally the
association of the characters is easy to understand on
obvious utilitarian principles; where for instance the alimentary
canal is adapted to the digestion of flesh, the jaws
and body must be adapted for the capture of the prey. But
association such as that between ruminant stomachs and
the presence of cloven hoofs and of horns in the male, or
of immunity to certain poisons with particular colouring of
the hair, or among domestic pigeons of short bills with
small feet, of long bills with large feet, or in cats of deafness
with white fur and blue eyes&mdash;such are extremely difficult
to refer to a single purpose.</p>

<p>I do not in the least mean to assert that science must be
content with no more than the mere discovery of correlations.
Such a position would be little better than that of a
person who was satisfied by finding out that the placing of
a penny in the slot of a particular automatic machine
always was followed by the release of a box of matches. It
would be making resignation the leading principle of metaphysics.
We shall get a good deal further by such correlations,
as, for instance, that of long hair and normal ovaries;
but these are within the sphere of physiology, not of
morphology. Probably the goal of an ideal morphology<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
could be reached best not by deductions from an attempted
synthesis of observations on all the animals that creep on
the land or swim in the sea (in the fashion of collectors of
postage stamps), but by a complete study of a few
organisms. Cuvier by a kind of guess-work used to reconstruct
an entire animal from a single bone: full
knowledge would enable us to do this in a complete,
definite, qualitative and quantitative fashion. When such a
knowledge has been attained, each single character will at
once define and limit for us the possibilities of the other
characters. Such a true and logical extension of the principle
of correlation in morphology is really an application
of the theory of functions to the living world. It would
not exclude the study of causation, but limit it to its proper
sphere. No doubt the &#8220;causes&#8221; of the correlations of
organisms must be sought for in the idioplasm.</p>

<p>The possibility of applying the principle of correlated
variation to psychology depends on differential psychology,
the study of psychological variation. I believe, moreover,
that a combination of study of the anatomical &#8220;habit,&#8221; and
the mental characteristics will lead to a statical psycho-physics,
a true science of physiognomy. The rule of
investigation in all the three sciences will have to be that
the question is posed as follows; given that two organisms
are known to differ in one respect, in what other respects
are they different? This will be the golden rule of discovery,
and, following it, we shall no longer lose ourselves
hopelessly in the dark maze that surrounds the answer to
the question &#8220;Why?&#8221; As soon as we are informed as to
one difference, we must diligently seek out the others, and
the mere putting of the question in this form will directly
bring about many discoveries.</p>

<p>The conscious pursuit of this rule of investigation will be
particularly valuable in dealing with problems of the mind.
Mental actions are not co-existent in the sense of physical
characters, and it has been only by accidental and fortunate
chances, when the phenomena have presented themselves
in rapid succession in an individual, that discoveries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
correlation in mental phenomena have been noticed. The
correlated mental phenomena may be very different in
kind, and it is only when we know what we are after and
deliberately seek for them that we shall be able to transcend
the special difficulties of the kind of material we are investigating,
and so secure for psychology what is comparatively
simple in anatomy.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
EMANCIPATED WOMEN</h3>

<p>As an immediate application of the attempt to establish the
principle of intermediate sexual forms by means of a
differential psychology, we must now come to the question
which it is the special object of this book to answer,
theoretically and practically, I mean the woman question,
theoretically so far as it is not a matter of ethnology and
national economics, and practically in so far as it is not
merely a matter of law and domestic economy, that is to
say, of social science in the widest sense. The answer
which this chapter is about to give must not be considered
as final or as exhaustive. It is rather a necessary preliminary
investigation, and does not go beyond deductions
from the principles that I have established. It will deal
with the exploration of individual cases and will not
attempt to found on these any laws of general significance.
The practical indications that it will give are not moral
maxims that could or would guide the future; they are no
more than technical rules abstracted from past cases. The
idea of male and female types will not be discussed here;
that is reserved for the second part of my book. This
preliminary investigation will deal with only those charactero-logical
conclusions from the principle of sexually
intermediate forms that are of significance in the woman
question.</p>

<p>The general direction of the investigation is easy to
understand from what has already been stated. A woman&#8217;s
demand for emancipation and her qualification for it are in
direct proportion to the amount of maleness in her. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
idea of emancipation, however, is many-sided, and its
indefiniteness is increased by its association with many
practical customs which have nothing to do with the theory
of emancipation. By the term emancipation of a woman
I imply neither her mastery at home nor her subjection of
her husband. I have not in mind the courage which
enables her to go freely by night or by day unaccompanied
in public places, or the disregard of social rules which
prohibit bachelor women from receiving visits from men,
or discussing or listening to discussions of sexual matters.
I exclude from my view the desire for economic independence,
the becoming fit for positions in technical schools,
universities and conservatoires or teachers&#8217; institutes. And
there may be many other similar movements associated
with the word emancipation which I do not intend to deal
with. Emancipation, as I mean to discuss it, is not the
wish for an outward equality with man, but what is of real
importance in the woman question, the deep-seated craving
to acquire man&#8217;s character, to attain his mental and moral
freedom, to reach his real interests and his creative power.
I maintain that the real female element has neither the
desire nor the capacity for emancipation in this sense. All
those who are striving for this real emancipation, all women
who are truly famous and are of conspicuous mental ability,
to the first glance of an expert reveal some of the anatomical
characters of the male, some external bodily resemblance
to a man. Those so-called &#8220;women&#8221; who have
been held up to admiration in the past and present, by the
advocates of woman&#8217;s rights, as examples of what women
can do, have almost invariably been what I have described
as sexually intermediate forms. The very first of the historical
examples, Sappho herself, has been handed down to
us as an example of the sexual invert, and from her name
has been derived the accepted terms for perverted sexual
relations between women. The contents of the second and
third chapter thus at once become important with regard to
the woman question. The characterological material at
our disposal with regard to celebrated and emancipated<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
women is too vague to serve as the foundation of any satisfactory
theory. What is wanted is some principle which
would enable us to determine at what point between male
and female such individuals were placed. My law of sexual
affinity is such a principle. Its application to the facts of
homo-sexuality showed that the woman who attracts and is
attracted by other women is herself half male. Interpreting
the historical evidence at our disposal in the light of this
principle, we find that the degree of emancipation and the
proportion of maleness in the composition of a woman are
practically identical. Sappho was only the forerunner of a
long line of famous women who were either homo-sexually
or bisexually inclined. Classical scholars have defended
Sappho warmly against the implication that there was
anything more than mere friendship in her relations with
her own sex, as if the accusation were necessarily degrading.
In the second part of my book, however, I shall show
reasons in favour of the possibility that homo-sexuality is a
higher form than hetero-sexuality. For the present, it is
enough to say that homo-sexuality in a woman is the outcome
of her masculinity and presupposes a higher degree of
development. Catherine II. of Russia, and Queen Christina
of Sweden, the highly gifted although deaf, dumb and blind,
Laura Bridgman, George Sand, and a very large number of
highly gifted women and girls concerning whom I myself
have been able to collect information, were partly bisexual,
partly homo-sexual.</p>

<p>I shall now turn to other indications in the case of the
large number of emancipated women regarding whom there
is no evidence as to homo-sexuality, and I shall show that
my attribution of maleness is no caprice, no egotistical wish
of a man to associate all the higher manifestations of intelligence
with the male sex. Just as homo-sexual or bisexual
women reveal their maleness by their preference either for
women or for womanish men, so hetero-sexual women display
maleness in their choice of a male partner who is not
preponderatingly male. The most famous of George Sand&#8217;s
many affairs were those with de Musset, the most effeminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
and sentimental poet, and with Chopin, who might be
described almost as the only female musician, so effeminate
are his compositions.<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Vittoria Colonna is less known
because of her own poetic compositions than because of
the infatuation for her shown by Michael Angelo, whose
earlier friendships had been with youths. The authoress,
Daniel Stern, was the mistress of Franz Liszt, whose life
and compositions were extremely effeminate, and who had
a dubious friendship with Wagner, the interpretation of
which was made plain by his later devotion to King
Ludwig II. of Bavaria. Madame de Staal, whose work on
Germany is probably the greatest book ever produced by a
woman, is supposed to have been intimate with August
Wilhelm Schlegel, who was a homo-sexualist, and who had
been tutor to her children. At certain periods of his life,
the face of the husband of Clara Schumann might have
been taken as that of a woman, and a good deal of his
music, although certainly not all, was effeminate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote5"><a href="#FNanchor5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
Chopin&#8217;s portraits show his effeminacy plainly. Merim&eacute;e
describes George Sand as being as thin as a nail. At the first
meeting of the two, the lady behaved like a man, and the man like
a girl. He blushed when she looked at him and began to pay him
compliments in her bass voice.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When there is no evidence as to the sexual relations of
famous women, we can still obtain important conclusions
from the details of their personal appearance. Such data
support my general proposition.</p>

<p>George Eliot had a broad, massive forehead; her movements,
like her expression, were quick and decided, and
lacked all womanly grace. The face of Lavinia Fontana
was intellectual and decided, very rarely charming; whilst
that of Rachel Ruysch was almost wholly masculine. The
biography of that original poetess, Annette von Droste-H&uuml;lshoff,
speaks of her wiry, unwomanly frame, and of her
face as being masculine, and recalling that of Dante. The
authoress and mathematician, Sonia Kowalevska, like
Sappho, had an abnormally scanty growth of hair, still less
than is the fashion amongst the poetesses and female<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
students of the present day. It would be a serious omission
to forget Rosa Bonheur, the very distinguished painter;
and it would be difficult to point to a single female trait
in her appearance or character. The notorious Madame
Blavatsky is extremely masculine in her appearance.</p>

<p>I might refer to many other emancipated women at
present well known to the public, consideration of whom
has provided me with much material for the support of
my proposition that the true female element, the abstract
&#8220;woman,&#8221; has nothing to do with emancipation. There is
some historical justification for the saying &#8220;the longer the
hair the smaller the brain,&#8221; but the reservations made in
chap. ii. must be taken into account.</p>

<p>It is only the male element in emancipated women that
craves for emancipation.</p>

<p>There is, then, a stronger reason than has generally been
supposed for the familiar assumption of male pseudonyms
by women writers. Their choice is a mode of giving expression
to the inherent maleness they feel; and this is
still more marked in the case of those who, like George
Sand, have a preference for male attire and masculine pursuits.
The motive for choosing a man&#8217;s name springs from
the feeling that it corresponds with their own character
much more than from any desire for increased notice from
the public. As a matter of fact, up to the present, partly
owing to interest in the sex question, women&#8217;s writings have
aroused more interest, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, than those of men;
and, owing to the issues involved, have always received a
fuller consideration and, if there were any justification, a
greater meed of praise than has been accorded to a man&#8217;s
work of equal merit. At the present time especially many
women have attained celebrity by work which, if it had
been produced by a man, would have passed almost unnoticed.
Let us pause and examine this more closely.</p>

<p>If we attempt to apply a standard taken from the names of
men who are of acknowledged value in philosophy, science,
literature and art, to the long list of women who have
achieved some kind of fame, there will at once be a miserable<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
collapse. Judged in this way, it is difficult to grant any
real degree of merit to women like Angelica Kaufmann or
Madame Lebrun, Fernan Caballero or Hroswitha von
Gandersheim, Mary Somerville or George Egerton, Elizabeth
Barrett Browning or Sophie Germain, Anna Maria
Schurmann or Sybilla Merian. I will not speak of names
(such as that of Droste-H&uuml;lshoff) formerly so over-rated in
the annals of feminism, nor will I refer to the measure of
fame claimed for or by living women. It is enough to
make the general statement that there is not a single woman
in the history of thought, not even the most manlike, who
can be truthfully compared with men of fifth or sixth-rate
genius, for instance with R&uuml;ckert as a poet, Van Dyck as a
painter, or Scheirmacher as a philosopher. If we eliminate
hysterical visionaries,<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> such as the Sybils, the Priestesses
of Delphi, Bourignon, Kettenberg, Jeanne de la Mothe
Guyon, Joanna Southcote, Beate Sturmin, St. Teresa, there
still remain cases like that of Marie Bashkirtseff. So far as
I can remember from her portrait, she at least seemed to be
quite womanly in face and figure, although her forehead
was rather masculine. But to any one who studies her
pictures in the Salle des Etrangers in the Luxemburg
Gallery in Paris, and compares them with those of her
adored master, Bastien Lepage, it is plain that she simply
had assimilated the style of the latter, as in Goethe&#8217;s &#8220;Elective
Affinities&#8221; Ottilie acquired the handwriting of Eduard.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote6"><a href="#FNanchor6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Hysteria is the principal cause of much of the intellectual
activity of many of the women above mentioned. But the usual
view, that these cases are pathological, is too limited an interpretation,
as I shall show in the second part of this work.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There remain the interesting and not infrequent cases
where the talent of a clever family seems to reach its maximum
in a female member of the family. But it is only
talent that is transmitted in this way, not genius. Margarethe
van Eyck and Sabina von Steinbach form the best
illustrations of the kind of artists who, according to Ernst
Guhl, an author with a great admiration for women-workers,
&#8220;have been undoubtedly influenced in their choice of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
artistic calling by their fathers, mothers, or brothers. In
other words, they found their incentive in their own families.
There are two or three hundred of such cases on record,
and probably many hundreds more could be added without
exhausting the numbers of similar instances.&#8221; In order to
give due weight to these statistics it may be mentioned that
Guhl had just been speaking of &#8220;roughly, a thousand names
of women artists known to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>This concludes my historical review of the emancipated
women. It has justified the assertion that real desire for
emancipation and real fitness for it are the outcome of a
woman&#8217;s maleness.</p>

<p>The vast majority of women have never paid special
attention to art or to science, and regard such occupations
merely as higher branches of manual labour, or if they profess
a certain devotion to such subjects, it is chiefly as a
mode of attracting a particular person or group of persons
of the opposite sex. Apart from these, a close investigation
shows that women really interested in intellectual matters
are sexually intermediate forms.</p>

<p>If it be the case that the desire for freedom and equality
with man occurs only in masculine women, the inductive
conclusion follows that the female principle is not conscious
of a necessity for emancipation; and the argument becomes
stronger if we remember that it is based on an examination
of the accounts of individual cases and not on psychical
investigation of an &#8220;abstract woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we now look at the question of emancipation from the
point of view of hygiene (not morality) there is no doubt as
to the harm in it. The undesirability of emancipation lies
in the excitement and agitation involved. It induces women
who have no real original capacity but undoubted imitative
powers to attempt to study or write, from various motives,
such as vanity or the desire to attract admirers. Whilst it
cannot be denied that there are a good many women with
a real craving for emancipation and for higher education,
these set the fashion and are followed by a host of others
who get up a ridiculous agitation to convince themselves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
the reality of their views. And many otherwise estimable
and worthy wives use the cry to assert themselves against
their husbands, whilst daughters take it as a method of
rebelling against maternal authority. The practical outcome
of the whole matter would be as follows; it being remembered
that the issues are too mutable for the establishment
of uniform rules or laws. Let there be the freest scope
given to, and the fewest hindrances put in the way of all
women with masculine dispositions who feel a psychical
necessity to devote themselves to masculine occupations and
are physically fit to undertake them. But the idea of making
an emancipation party, of aiming at a social revolution,
must be abandoned. Away with the whole &#8220;woman&#8217;s
movement,&#8221; with its unnaturalness and artificiality and its
fundamental errors.</p>

<p>It is most important to have done with the senseless cry
for &#8220;full equality,&#8221; for even the malest woman is scarcely
more than 50 per cent. male, and it is only to that male
part of her that she owes her special capacity or whatever
importance she may eventually gain. It is absurd to make
comparisons between the few really intellectual women
and one&#8217;s average experience of men, and to deduce, as
has been done, even the superiority of the female sex.
As Darwin pointed out, the proper comparison is between
the most highly developed individuals of two stocks.
&#8220;If two lists,&#8221; Darwin wrote in the &#8220;Descent of Man,&#8221;
&#8220;were made of the most eminent men and women in
poetry, painting, sculpture, music&mdash;comprising composition
and performance, history, science, and philosophy, with
half a dozen names under each subject, the two lists
would not bear comparison.&#8221; Moreover, if these lists
were carefully examined it would be seen that the
women&#8217;s list would prove the soundness of my theory
of the maleness of their genius, and the comparison would
be still less pleasing to the champions of woman&#8217;s rights.</p>

<p>It is frequently urged that it is necessary to create a
public feeling in favour of the full and unchecked mental
development of women. Such an argument overlooks<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
the fact that &#8220;emancipation,&#8221; the &#8220;woman question,&#8221;
&#8220;women&#8217;s rights movements,&#8221; are no new things in history,
but have always been with us, although with varying
prominence at different times in history. It also largely
exaggerates the difficulties men place in the way of the
mental development of women, especially at the present
time.<a id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Furthermore it neglects the fact that at the present
time it is not the true woman who clamours for emancipation,
but only the masculine type of woman, who
misconstrues her own character and the motives that
actuate her when she formulates her demands in the name
of woman.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote7"><a href="#FNanchor7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> There have been many celebrities amongst men who received
practically no education&mdash;for instance, Robert Burns and Wolfram
von Eschenbach; but there are no similar cases amongst women to
compare with them.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As has been the case with every other movement in
history, so also it has been with the contemporary woman&#8217;s
movement. Its originators were convinced that it was being
put forward for the first time, and that such a thing had
never been thought of before. They maintained that women
had hitherto been held in bondage and enveloped in darkness
by man, and that it was high time for her to assert herself
and claim her natural rights.</p>

<p>But the prototype of this movement, as of other movements,
occurred in the earliest times. Ancient history and
medi&aelig;val times alike give us instances of women who, in
social relations and intellectual matters, fought for such
emancipation, and of male and female apologists of the
female sex. It is totally erroneous to suggest that hitherto
women have had no opportunity for the undisturbed
development of their mental powers.</p>

<p>Jacob Burckhardt, speaking of the Renaissance, says:
&#8220;The greatest possible praise which could be given to the
Italian women-celebrities of the time was to say that they
were like men in brains and disposition!&#8221; The virile
deeds of women recorded in the epics, especially those of
Boiardo and Ariosto, show the ideal of the time. To call<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
a woman a &#8220;virago&#8221; nowadays would be a doubtful compliment,
but it originally meant an honour.</p>

<p>Women were first allowed on the stage in the sixteenth
century, and actresses date from that time. &#8220;At that
period it was admitted that women were just as capable as
men of embodying the highest possible artistic ideals.&#8221;
It was the period when panegyrics on the female sex were
rife; Sir Thomas More claimed for it full equality with the
male sex, and Agrippa von Nettesheim goes so far as to
represent women as superior to men! And yet this was
all lost for the fair sex, and the whole question sank into
the oblivion from which the nineteenth century recalled it.</p>

<p>Is it not very remarkable that the agitation for the emancipation
of women seems to repeat itself at certain intervals
in the world&#8217;s history, and lasts for a definite period?</p>

<p>It has been noticed that in the tenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth,
and now again in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, the agitation for the emancipation of women has
been more marked, and the woman&#8217;s movement more
vigorous than in the intervening periods. It would be
premature to found a hypothesis on the data at our disposal,
but the possibility of a vastly important periodicity
must be borne in mind, of regularly recurring periods in
which it may be that there is an excess of production of
hermaphrodite and sexually intermediate forms. Such a
state of affairs is not unknown in the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>According to my interpretation, such a period would be
one of minimum &#8220;gonochorism,&#8221; cleavage of the sexes;
and it would be marked, on the one hand, by an increased
production of male women, and on the other, by a similar
increase in female men. There is strong evidence in favour
of such a periodicity; if it occurs it may be associated with
the &#8220;secessionist taste,&#8221; which idealised tall, lanky women
with flat chests and narrow hips. The enormous recent
increase in a kind of dandified homo-sexuality may be due
to the increasing effeminacy of the age, and the peculiarities
of the Pre-Raphaelite movement may have a similar
explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>The existence of such periods in organic life, comparable
with stages in individual life, but extending over several
generations, would, if proved, throw much light on many
obscure points in human history, concerning which the
so-called &#8220;historical solutions,&#8221; and especially the economic-materialistic
views now in vogue have proved so futile. The
history of the world from the biological standpoint has still
to be written; it lies in the future. Here I can do little more
than indicate the direction which future work should take.</p>

<p>Were it proved that at certain periods fewer hermaphrodite
beings were produced, and at certain other periods
more, it would appear that the rising and falling, the periodic
occurrence and disappearance of the woman movement in
an unfailing rhythm of ebb and flow, was one of the expressions
of the preponderance of masculine and feminine
women with the concomitant greater or lesser desire for
emancipation.</p>

<p>Obviously I do not take into account in relation to the
woman question the large number of womanly women, the
wives of the prolific artisan class whom economic pressure
forces to factory or field labour. The connection between
industrial progress and the woman question is much less
close than is usually realised, especially by the Social
Democratic Group. The relation between the mental
energy required for intellectual and for industrial pursuits
is even less. France, for instance, although it can boast
three of the most famous women, has never had a successful
woman&#8217;s movement, and yet in no other European country
are there so many really businesslike, capable women.
The struggle for the material necessities of life has nothing
to do with the struggle for intellectual development, and a
sharp distinction must be made between the two.</p>

<p>The prospects of the movement for intellectual advance
on the part of women are not very promising; but still less
promising is another view, sometimes discussed in the
same connection, the view that the human race is moving
towards a complete sexual differentiation, a definite sexual
dimorphism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span></p>

<p>The latter view seems to me fundamentally untenable,
because in the higher groups of the animal kingdom there
is no evidence for the increase of sexual dimorphism.
Worms and rotifers, many birds and the mandrills amongst
the apes, have more advanced sexual dimorphism than man.
On the view that such an increased sexual dimorphism
were to be expected, the necessity for emancipation would
gradually disappear as mankind became separated into the
completely male and the completely female. On the other
hand, the view that there will be periodical resurrections
of the woman&#8217;s movement would reduce the whole affair to
ridiculous impotence, making it only an ephemeral phase in
the history of mankind.</p>

<p>A complete obliteration will be the fate of any emancipation
movement which attempts to place the whole sex in a
new relation to society, and to see in man its perpetual
oppressor. A corps of Amazons might be formed, but as
time went on the material for the corps would cease to
occur. The history of the woman movement during the
Renaissance and its complete disappearance contains a
lesson for the advocates of women&#8217;s rights. Real intellectual
freedom cannot be attained by an agitated mass; it must be
fought for by the individual. Who is the enemy? What
are the retarding influences?</p>

<p>The greatest, the one enemy of the emancipation of
women is woman herself. It is left to the second part of
my work to prove this.</p>

<p class="allclear">A free field for the investigation of the actual contrasts
between the sexes is gained when we recognise that male
and female, man and woman, must be considered only as
types, and that the existing individuals, upon whose qualities
there has been so much controversy, are mixtures of the
types in different proportions. Sexually intermediate forms,
which are the only actually existing individuals, were dealt
with in a more or less schematic fashion in the first part of
this book. Consideration of the general biological application
of my theory was entered upon there; but now I have
to make mankind the special subject of my investigation,
and to show the defects of the results gained by the method
of introspective analysis, as these results must be qualified
by the universal existence of sexually intermediate conditions.
In plants and animals the presence of hermaphroditism
is an undisputed fact; but in them it appears more
to be the juxtaposition of the male and female genital
glands in the same individual than an actual fusion of the
two sexes, more the co-existence of the two extremes than
a quite neutral condition. In the case of human beings,
however, it appears to be psychologically true that an individual,
at least at one and the same moment, is always
either man or woman. This is in harmony with the fact
that each individual, whether superficially regarded as male
or female, at once can recognise his sexual complement in<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
another individual &#8220;woman&#8221; or &#8220;man.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This uni-sexuality
is demonstrated by the fact, the theoretical value of which
can hardly be over-estimated, that, in the relations of two
homo-sexual men one always plays the physical and psychical
roll of the man, and in cases of prolonged intercourse
retains his male first-name, or takes one, whilst the
other, who plays the part of the woman, either assumes a
woman&#8217;s name or calls himself by it, or&mdash;and this is sufficiently
characteristic&mdash;receives it from the former.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote8"><a href="#FNanchor8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> I once heard a bi-sexual man exclaim, when he saw a bi-sexual
actress with a slight tendency to a beard, a deep sonorous voice,
and very little hair on her head, &#8220;There is a fine woman.&#8221;
&#8220;Woman&#8221; means something different for every man or for every
poet, and yet it is always the same, the sexual complement of their
own constitution.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the same way, in the sexual relations of two women,
one always plays the male and the other the female part, a
fact of deepest significance. Here we encounter, in a
most unexpected fashion, the fundamental relationship
between the male and female elements. In spite of all
sexually intermediate conditions, human beings are always
one of two things, either male or female. There is a deep
truth underlying the old empirical sexual duality, and this
must not be neglected, even although in concrete cases
there is not a necessary harmony in the anatomical and
morphological conditions. To realise this is to make a
great step forward and to advance towards most important
results. In this way we reach a conception of a real
&#8220;being.&#8221; The task of the rest of this book is to set forth
the significance of this &#8220;existence.&#8221; As, however, this
existence is bound up with the most difficult side of
characterology, it will be well, before setting out on our
adventurous task, to attempt some preliminary orientation.</p>

<p>The obstacles in the way of characterological investigation
are very great, if only on account of the complexity of
the material. Often and often it happens that when the
path through the jungle appears to have been cleared, it is
lost again in impenetrable thickets, and it seems impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
to recover it. But the greatest difficulty is that when the
systematic method of setting out the complex material has
been proceeded with and seems about to lead to good
results, then at once objections of the most serious kind
arise and almost forbid the attempt to make types. With
regard to the differences between the sexes, for instance,
the most useful theory that has been put forward is the
existence of a kind of polarity, two extremes separated by
a multitude of intermediate conditions. The characterological
differences appear to follow this rule in a fashion not
dissimilar to the suggestion of the Pythagorean, Alcm&aelig;on
of Kroton, and recalling the recent chemical resurrection
of Schelling&#8217;s &#8220;Natur-philosophie.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even if we are able to determine the exact point
occupied by an individual on the line between two extremes,
and multiply this determination by discovering it
for a great many characters, would this complex system of
co-ordinate lines really give us a conception of the individual?
Would it not be a relapse to the dogmatic scepticism
of Mach and Hume, were we to expect that an analysis
could be a full description of the human individual?
And in a fashion it would be a sort of Weismannistic doctrine
of particulate determinants, a mosaic psychology.</p>

<p>This brings us in a new way directly against the old, over-ripe
problem. Is there in a man a single and simple existence,
and, if so, in what relation does that stand to the
complex psychical phenomena? Has man, indeed, a soul?
It is easy to understand why there has never been a science
of character. The object of such a science, the character
itself, is problematical. The problem of all metaphysics
and theories of knowledge, the fundamental problem of
psychology, is also the problem of characterology. At the
least, characterology will have to take into account the
theory of knowledge itself with regard to its postulates,
claims, and objects, and will have to attempt to obtain information
as to all the differences in the nature of men.</p>

<p>This unlimited science of character will be something
more than the &#8220;psychology of individual differences,&#8221; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
renewed insistence upon which as a goal of science we owe
to L. William Stern; it will be more than a sort of polity of
the motor and sensory reactions of the individual, and in so
far will not sink so low as the usual &#8220;results&#8221; of the modern
experimental psychologists, which, indeed, are little more
than statistics of physical experiments. It will hope to
retain some kind of contact with the actualities of the soul
which the modern school of psychology seems to have
forgotten, and will not have to fear that it will have to offer
to ardent students of psychology no more than profound
studies of words of one syllable, or of the results on the
mind of small doses of caffein. It is a lamentable testimony
to the insufficiency of modern psychology that distinguished
men of science, who have not been content with the study
of perception and association, have yet had to hand over to
poetry the explanation of such fundamental facts as heroism
and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>No science will become shallow so quickly as psychology
if it deserts philosophy. Its separation from philosophy is
the true cause of its impotency. Psychology will have to
discover that the doctrine of sensations is practically useless
to it. The empirical psychologists of to-day, in their search
for the development of character, begin with investigation
of touch and the common sensations. But the analysis of
sensations is simply a part of the physiology of sense, and
any attempt to bring it into relation with the real problems
of psychology must fail.</p>

<p>It is a misfortune of the scientific psychology of the day
that it has been influenced so deeply by two physicists,
Fechner and von Helmholtz, with the result that it has
failed to recognise that only the external and not the
internal world can be reconstructed from sensations. The
two most intelligent of the empirical psychologists of recent
times, William James and R. Avenarius, have felt almost
instinctively that psychology cannot really rest upon sensations
of the skin and muscles, although, indeed, all modern
psychology does depend upon study of sensations. Dilthey
did not lay enough stress on his argument that existing<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
psychology does nothing towards problems that are
eminently psychological, such as murder, friendship, loneliness,
and so forth. If anything is to be gained in the
future there must be a demand for a really psychological
psychology, and its first battle-cry must be: &#8220;Away with
the study of sensations.&#8221;</p>

<p>In attempting the broad and deep characterology that I
have indicated, I must set out with a conception of character
itself as a unit existence. As in the fifth chapter of Part I.,
I tried to show that behind the fleeting physiological changes
there is a permanent morphological form, so in characterology
we must seek the permanent, existing something
through the fleeting changes.</p>

<p>The character, however, is not something seated behind
the thoughts and feelings of the individual, but something
revealing itself in every thought and feeling. &#8220;All that a
man does is physiognomical of him.&#8221; Just as every cell
bears within it the characters of the whole individual, so
every psychical manifestation of a man involves not merely a
few little characteristic traits, but his whole being, of which
at one moment one quality, at another moment another
quality, comes into prominence.</p>

<p>Just as no sensation is ever isolated, but is set in a complete
field of sensation, the world of the Ego, of which now
one part and now the other, stands out more plainly, so the
whole man is manifest in every moment of the psychical
life, although, now one side, now the other, is more visible.
This existence, manifest in every moment of the psychical
life, is the object of characterology. By accepting this,
there will be completed for the first time a real psychology,
existing psychology, in manifest contradiction of the meaning
of the word, having concerned itself almost entirely with
the motley world, the changing field of sensations, and overlooked
the ruling force of the Ego. The new psychology
would be a doctrine of the whole, and would become fresh
and fertile inasmuch as it would combine the complexity
of the subject and of the object, two spheres which can be
separated only in abstraction. Many disputed points of<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
psychology (perhaps the most important) would be settled
by an application of such characterology, as that would
explain why so many different views have been held on the
same subject. The same psychical process appears from
time to time in different aspects, merely because it takes tone
and colouring from the individual character. And so it
well may be that the doctrine of differential psychology may
receive its completion in the domain of general psychology.</p>

<p>The confusion of characterology with the doctrine of the
soul has been a great misfortune, but because this has
occurred in actual history, is no reason why it should continue.
The absolute sceptic differs only in a word from the
absolute dogmatist. The man who dogmatically accepts
the position of absolute phenomenalism, believing it to
relieve him of all the burden of proof that the mere entering
on another standpoint would itself entail, will be ready to
dismiss without proof the existence which characterology
posits, and which has nothing to do with a metaphysical
&#8220;essence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Characterology has to defend itself against two great
enemies. The one assumes that character is something
ultimate, and as little the subject-matter of science as is
the art of a painter. The other looks on the sensations
as the only realities, on sensation as the ground-work of
the world of the Ego, and denies the existence of character.
What is left for characterology, the science of
character? On the one hand, there are those who cry,
&#8220;De individuo nulla scientia,&#8221; and &#8220;Individuum est ineffabile&#8221;;
on the other hand, there are those sworn to
science, who maintain that science has nothing to do with
character.</p>

<p>In such a cross-fire, characterology has to take its place,
and it may well be feared that it may share the fate of its
sisters and remain a trivial subject like physiognomy or a
diviner&#8217;s art like graphology.</p>

<p>By psychology, as a whole, we generally understand the
psychology of the psychologists, and these are exclusively
men! Never since human history began have we heard
of a female psychology! None the less the psychology
of woman constitutes a chapter as important with regard to
general psychology as that of the child. And inasmuch as
the psychology of man has always been written with unconscious
but definite reference to man, general psychology
has become simply the psychology of men, and the problem
of the psychology of the sexes will be raised as soon as the
existence of a separate psychology of women has been
realised. Kant said that in anthropology the peculiarities
of the female were more a study for the philosopher than
those of the male, and it may be that the psychology of the
sexes will disappear in a psychology of the female.</p>

<p>None the less the psychology of women will have to be
written by men. It is easy to suggest that such an attempt
is foredoomed to failure, inasmuch as the conclusions must
be drawn from an alien sex and cannot be verified by introspection.
Granted the possibility that woman could
describe herself with sufficient exactness, it by no means
follows that she would be interested in the sides of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
character that would interest us. Moreover, even if she
could and would explore herself fully, it is doubtful if she
could bring herself to talk about herself. I shall show that
these three improbabilities spring from the same source
in the nature of woman.</p>

<p>This investigation, therefore, lays itself open to the
charge that no one who is not female can be in a position
to make accurate statements about women. In the
meantime the objection must stand, although, later, I shall
have more to say of it. I will say only this much&mdash;up to
now, and is this only a consequence of man&#8217;s suppression?&mdash;we
have no account from a pregnant woman of her sensations
and feelings, neither in poetry nor in memoirs, nor
even in a gyn&aelig;cological treatise. This cannot be on
account of excessive modesty, for, as Schopenhauer rightly
pointed out, there is nothing so far removed from a pregnant
woman as shame as to her condition. Besides, there would
still remain to them the possibility of, after the birth, confessing
from memory the psychical life during the time; if
a sense of shame had prevented them from such communication
during the time, it would be gone afterwards, and
the varied interests of such a disclosure ought to have
induced some one to break silence. But this has not been
done. Just as we have always been indebted to men for
really trustworthy expositions of the psychical side of
women, so also it is to men that we owe descriptions of
the sensations of pregnant women. What is the meaning
of this?</p>

<p>Although in recent times we have had revelations of the
psychical life of half-women and three-quarter women, it is
practically only about the male side of them that they have
written. We have really only one clue; we have to rely
upon the female element in men. The principle of sexually
intermediate forms is the authority for what we know about
women through men. I shall define and complete the
application of this principle later on. In its indefinite form,
the principle would seem to imply that the most womanish
man would be best able to describe woman, and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
description might be completed by the real woman.
This, however, is extremely doubtful. I must point out
that a man can have a considerable proportion of femaleness
in him without necessarily, to the same extent, being
able to portray intermediate forms. It is the more remarkable
that the male can give a faithful account of the nature
of the female; since, indeed, it must be admitted from the
extreme maleness of successful portrayers of women that
we cannot dispute the existence of this capacity in the
abstract male; this power of the male over the female is a
most remarkable problem, and we shall have to consider it
later. For the present we must take it as a fact, and proceed
to inquire in what lies the actual psychological
difference between male and female.</p>

<p>It has been sought to attribute the fundamental difference
of the sexes to the existence of a stronger sexual impulse in
man, and to derive everything else from that. Apart from the
question as to whether the phrase &#8220;sexual instinct&#8221; denotes
a simple and real thing, it is to be doubted if there is proof of
such a difference. It is not more probable than the ancient
theories as to the influence of the &#8220;unsatisfied womb&#8221; in
the female, or of the &#8220;semen retentum&#8221; in men, and we
have to be on guard against the current tendency to refer
nearly everything to sublimated sexual instinct. No systematic
theory could be founded on a generalisation so
vague. It is most improbable that the greater or lesser
strength of the sexual impulse determines other qualities.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the statements that men have stronger
sexual impulses than women, or that women have them
stronger than men, are false. The strength of the sexual
impulse in a man does not depend upon the proportion of
masculinity in his composition, and in the same way the
degree of femininity of a woman does not determine her
sexual impulse. These differences in mankind still await
classification.</p>

<p>Contrary to the general opinion, there is no difference in
the total sexual impulses of the sexes. However, if we
examine the matter in respect to the two component forces<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
into which Albert Moll analysed the impulse, we shall find
that a difference does exist. These forces may be termed
the &#8220;liberating&#8221; and the &#8220;uniting&#8221; impulses. The first
appears in the form of the discomfort caused by the accumulation
of ripe sexual cells; the second is the desire of
the ripe individual for sexual completion. Both impulses
are possessed by the male; in the female only the latter is
present. The anatomy and the physiological processes of
the sexes bear out the distinction.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be noted that only the most
male youths are addicted to masturbation, and although
it is often disputed, I believe that similar vices occur only
among the maler of women, and are absent from the female
nature.</p>

<p>I must now discuss the &#8220;uniting&#8221; impulse of woman, for
that plays the chief, if not the sole part in her sexuality.
But it must not be supposed that this is greater in one sex
than the other. Any such idea comes from a confusion
between the desire for a thing and the stimulus towards the
active part in securing what is desired. Throughout the
animal and plant kingdoms, the male reproductive cells are
the motile, active agents, which move through space to seek
out the passive female cells, and this physiological difference
is sometimes confused with the actual wish for, or stimulus
to, sexual union. And to add to the confusion, it happens,
in the animal kingdom particularly, that the male, in addition
to the directly sexual stimulus, has the instinct to pursue
and bodily capture the female, whilst the latter has only the
passive part to be taken possession of. These differences
of habit must not be mistaken for real differences of desire.</p>

<p>It can be shown, moreover, that woman is sexually much
more excitable (not more sensitive) physiologically than
man.</p>

<p>The condition of sexual excitement is the supreme moment
of a woman&#8217;s life. The woman is devoted wholly to sexual
matters, that is to say, to the spheres of begetting and of
reproduction. Her relations to her husband and children
complete her life, whereas the male is something more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
sexual. In this respect, rather than in the relative strength
of the sexual impulses, there is a real difference between the
sexes. It is important to distinguish between the intensity
with which sexual matters are pursued and the proportion
of the total activities of life that are devoted to them and to
their accessory cares. The greater absorption of the human
female by the sphere of sexual activities is the most significant
difference between the sexes.</p>

<p>The female, moreover, is completely occupied and content
with sexual matters, whilst the male is interested in much
else, in war and sport, in social affairs and feasting, in philosophy
and science, in business and politics, in religion and
art. I do not mean to imply that this difference has always
existed, as I do not think that important. As in the case of
the Jewish question, it may be said that the Jews have their
present character because it has been forced upon them, and
that at one time they were different. It is now impossible to
prove this, and we may leave it to those who believe in the
modification by the environment to accept it. The historical
evidence is equivocal on the point. In the question
of women, we have to take people as they exist to-day. If,
however, we happen to come on attributes that could not
possibly have been grafted on them from without, we may
believe that such have always been with them. Of contemporary
women at least one thing is certain. Apart from
an exception to be noted in chap. xii., it is certain that
when the female occupies herself with matters outside the
interests of sex, it is for the man that she loves or by whom
she wishes to be loved. She takes no real interest in the
things for themselves. It may happen that a real female
learns Latin; if so, it is for some such purpose as to help her
son who is at school. Desire for a subject and ability for
it, interest in it, and the facility for acquiring it, are usually
proportional. He who has slight muscles has no desire to
wield an axe; those without the faculty for mathematics do
not desire to study that subject. Talent seems to be rare
and feeble in the real female (although possibly it is merely
that the dominant sexuality prevents its development), with<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
the result that woman has no power of forming the combinations
which, although they do not actually make the
individuality, certainly shape it.</p>

<p>Corresponding to true women, there are extremely female
men who are to be found always in the apartments of the
women, and who are interested in nothing but love and
sexual matters. Such men, however, are not the Don Juans.</p>

<p>The female principle is, then, nothing more than sexuality;
the male principle is sexual and something more. This
difference is notable in the different way in which men and
women enter the period of puberty. In the case of the
male the onset of puberty is a crisis; he feels that something
new and strange has come into his being, that something
has been added to his powers and feelings independently of
his will. The physiological stimulus to sexual activity appears
to come from outside his being, to be independent of his will,
and many men remember the disturbing event throughout
their after lives. The woman, on the other hand, not only
is not disturbed by the onset of puberty, but feels that her
importance has been increased by it. The male, as a youth,
has no longing for the onset of sexual maturity; the female,
from the time when she is still quite a young girl, looks
forward to that time as one from which everything is to be
expected. Man&#8217;s arrival at maturity is frequently accompanied
by feelings of repulsion and disgust; the young
female watches the development of her body at the approach
of puberty with excitement and impatient delight. It seems
as if the onset of puberty were a side path in the normal
development of man, whereas in the case of woman it is the
direct conclusion. There are few boys approaching puberty
to whom the idea that they would marry (in the general
sense, not a particular girl) would not appear ridiculous,
whilst the smallest girl is almost invariably excited and
interested in the question of her future marriage. For such
reasons a woman assigns positive value only to her period of
maturity in her own case and in that of other women; in
childhood, as in old age, she has no real relation to the
world. The thought of her childhood is for her, later on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
only the remembrance of her stupidity; she faces the
approach of old age with dislike and abhorrence. The only
real memories of her childhood are connected with sex, and
these fade away in the intensely greater significance of her
maturity. The passage of a woman from virginity is the
great dividing point of her life, whilst the corresponding
event in the case of a male has very little relation to the
course of his life.</p>

<p>Woman is only sexual, man is partly sexual, and this
difference reveals itself in various ways. The parts of the
male body by stimulation of which sexuality is excited are
limited in area, and are strongly localised, whilst in the case
of the woman, they are diffused over her whole body, so
that stimulation may take place almost from any part.
When in the second chapter of Part I., I explained that
sexuality is distributed over the whole body in both sexes, I
did not mean that, therefore, the sense organs, through which
the definite impulses are stimulated, were equally distributed.
There are, certainly, areas of greater excitability, even in the
case of the woman, but there is not, as in the man, a sharp
division between the sexual areas and the body generally.</p>

<p>The morphological isolation of the sexual area from the
rest of the body in the case of man, may be taken as symbolical
of the relation of sex to his whole nature. Just as
there is a contrast between the sexual and the sexless parts
of a man&#8217;s body, so there is a time-change in his sexuality.
The female is always sexual, the male is sexual only intermittently.
The sexual instinct is always active in woman
(as to the apparent exceptions to this sexuality of women, I
shall have to speak later on), whilst in man it is at rest from
time to time. And thus it happens that the sexual impulse of
the male is eruptive in character and so appears stronger.
The real difference between the sexes is that in the male
the desire is periodical, in the female continuous.</p>

<p>This exclusive and persisting sexuality of the female has
important physical and psychical consequences. As the
sexuality of the male is an adjunct to his life, it is possible
for him to keep it in the physiological background, and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
of his consciousness. And so a man can lay aside his
sexuality and not have to reckon with it. A woman has not
her sexuality limited to periods of time, nor to localised
organs. And so it happens that a man can know about his
sexuality, whilst a woman is unconscious of it and can in
all good faith deny it, because she is nothing but sexuality,
because she is sexuality itself.</p>

<p>It is impossible for women, because they are only sexual,
to recognise their sexuality, because recognition of anything
requires duality. With man it is not only that he is not
merely sexual, but anatomically and physiologically he can
&#8220;detach&#8221; himself from it. That is why he has the power
to enter into whatever sexual relations he desires; if he
likes he can limit or increase such relations; he can refuse
or assent to them. He can play the part of a Don Juan or
a monk. He can assume which he will. To put it bluntly,
man possesses sexual organs; her sexual organs possess
woman.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, deduce from the previous arguments
that man has the power of consciousness of his sexuality
and so can act against it, whilst the woman appears to
be without this power. This implies, moreover, that there is
greater differentiation in man, as in him the sexual and the
unsexual parts of his nature are sharply separated. The
possibility or impossibility of being aware of a particular
definite object is, however, hardly a part of the customary
meaning of the word consciousness, which is generally used
as implying that if a being is conscious he can be conscious
of any object. This brings me to consider the nature of
the female consciousness, and I must take a long <i>d&eacute;tour</i> to
consider it.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER III</span><br />
MALE AND FEMALE CONSCIOUSNESS</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to consider the main difference between
the psychical life of the sexes, so far as the latter takes
subjective and objective things as its contents, a few psychological
soundings must be taken, and conceptions
formulated. As the views and principles of prevailing
systems of psychology have been formed without consideration
of the subject of this book, it is not surprising
that they contain little that I am able to use. At present
there is no psychology but many psychologists, and it
would really be a matter of caprice on my part to choose
any particular school and attempt to apply its principles
to my subject. I shall rather try to lay down a few useful
principles on my own account.</p>

<p>The endeavours to reach a comprehensive and unifying
conception of the whole psychical process by referring it to
a single principle have been particularly evident in the
relations between perceptions and sensations suggested by
different psychologists. Herbart, for instance, derived
the sensations from elementary ideas, whilst Horwicz
supposed them to come from perceptions. Most modern
psychologists have insisted that such monistic attempts
must be fruitless. None the less there was some truth in
the view.</p>

<p>To discover this truth, however, it is necessary to make a
distinction that has been overlooked by modern workers.
We must distinguish between the perceiving of a perception,
feeling of a sensation, thinking a thought from the
later repetitions of the process in which recognition plays a<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
part. In many cases this distinction is of fundamental
importance.</p>

<p>Every simple, clear, plastic perception and every distinct
idea, before it could be put into words, passes through a
stage (which may indeed be very short) of indistinctness.
So also in the case of association; for a longer or shorter
time before the elements about to be grouped have actually
come together, there is a sort of vague, generalised expectation
or presentiment of association. Leibnitz, in particular,
has worked at kindred processes, and I believe them to
underlie the attempts of Herbart and Horwicz.</p>

<p>The common acceptance of pleasure and pain as the
fundamental sensations, even with Wundt&#8217;s addition of the
sensations of tension and relaxation, of rest and stimulation,
makes the division of psychical phenomena into sensations
and perceptions too narrow for due treatment of the vague
preliminary stages to which I have referred. I shall go back
therefore to the widest classification of psychical phenomena
that I know of, that of Avenarius into &#8220;elements&#8221; and
&#8220;characters.&#8221; The word &#8220;character&#8221; in this connection,
of course, has nothing to do with the subject of characterology.</p>

<p>Avenarius added to the difficulty of applying his theories
by his use of a practically new terminology (which is certainly
most striking and indispensable for some of the new
views he expounded). But what stands most in the way of
accepting some of his conclusions is his desire to derive his
psychology from the physiology of the brain, a physiology
which he evolved himself out of his inner consciousness
with only a slight general acquaintance with actual biological
facts. The psychological, or second part of his &#8220;Critique
of Pure Experience,&#8221; was really the source from which he
derived the first or physiological part, with the result that
the latter appears to its readers as an account of some discovery
in Atlantis. Because of these difficulties I shall
give here a short account of the system of Avenarius, as I
find it useful for my thesis.</p>

<p>An &#8220;Element&#8221; in the sense of Avenarius represents what<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
the usual psychology terms a perception, or the content of a
perception, what Schopenhauer called a presentation, what
in England is called an &#8220;impression&#8221; or &#8220;idea,&#8221; the
&#8220;thing,&#8221; &#8220;fact,&#8221; or &#8220;object&#8221; of ordinary language; and
the word is used independently of the presence or absence
of a special sense-organ stimulation&mdash;a most important and
novel addition. In the sense of Avenarius, and for our
purpose, it is a matter of indifference to the terminology how
far what is called &#8220;analysis&#8221; takes place, the whole tree may
be taken as the &#8220;element,&#8221; or each single leaf, or each hair,
or (where most people would stop), the colours, sizes,
weights, temperatures, resistances, and so forth. Still, the
analysis may go yet further, and the colour of the leaf may
be taken as merely the resultant of its quality, intensity,
luminosity, and so forth, these being the elements. Or we
may go still further and take modern ultimate conceptions
reaching units incapable of sub-division.</p>

<p>In the sense of Avenarius, then, elements are such ideas
as &#8220;green,&#8221; &#8220;blue,&#8221; &#8220;cold,&#8221; &#8220;warm,&#8221; &#8220;soft,&#8221; &#8220;hard,&#8221;
&#8220;sweet,&#8221; &#8220;bitter,&#8221; and their &#8220;character&#8221; is the particular
kind of quality with which they appear, not merely their
pleasantness or unpleasantness, but also such modes of
presentation as &#8220;surprising,&#8221; &#8220;expected,&#8221; &#8220;novel,&#8221; &#8220;indifferent,&#8221;
&#8220;recognised,&#8221; &#8220;known,&#8221; &#8220;actual,&#8221; &#8220;doubtful,&#8221;
categories which Avenarius first recognised as being psychological.
For instance, what I guess, believe, or know is an
&#8220;element&#8221;; the fact that I guess it, not believe it or know
it, is the &#8220;character&#8221; in which it presents itself psychologically
(not logically).</p>

<p>Now there is a stage in mental activity in which this
sub-division of psychical phenomena cannot be made,
which is too early for it. All &#8220;elements&#8221; at their first
appearance are merged with the floating background, the
whole being vaguely tinged by &#8220;character.&#8221; To follow
my meaning, think of what takes place, when for the first
time at a distance one sees something in the landscape,
such as a shrub or a heap of wood, at the moment when
one does not yet know what &#8220;it&#8221; is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span></p>

<p>At this moment &#8220;element&#8221; and &#8220;character&#8221; are absolutely
indistinguishable (they are always inseparable as
Petzoldt ingeniously pointed out), so improving the original
statement of Avenarius.</p>

<p>In a dense crowd I perceive, for instance, a face which
attracts me across the swaying mass by its expression. I
have no idea what the face is like, and should be quite
unable to describe it or give an idea of it; but it has
appealed to me in the most disturbing manner, and I find
myself asking with keen curiosity, &#8220;Where have I seen that
face before?&#8221;</p>

<p>A man may see the head of a woman for a moment, and
this may make a very strong impression on him, and yet he
may be unable to say exactly what he has seen, or, for
instance, be able to remember the colour of her hair. The
retina must be exposed to the object sufficiently long, if
only a fraction of a second, for a photographic impression
to be made.</p>

<p>If one looks at any object from a considerable distance
one has at first only the vaguest impression of its outlines;
and as one comes nearer and sees the details more clearly,
lively sensations, at first lost in the general mass, are
received. Think, for instance, of the first general impression
of, say, the sphenoid bone disarticulated from a skull,
or of many pictures seen a little too closely or a little too
far away. I myself have a remembrance of having had
strong impressions from sonatas of Beethoven before I
knew anything of the musical notes. Avenarius and Petzoldt
have overlooked the fact that the coming into consciousness
of the elements is accompanied by a kind of
secretion of characterisation.</p>

<p>Some of the simple experiments of physiological psychology
illustrate the point to which I have been referring.
If one stays in a dark room until the eye has adapted itself
to the absence of light, and then for a second subjects
oneself to a ray of coloured light, a sensation of illumination
will be received, although it is impossible to recognise
the quality of the illumination; something has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
perceived, but what the something is cannot be apprehended
unless the stimulation lasts a definite time.</p>

<p>In the same way every scientific discovery, every technical
invention, every artistic creation passes through a
preliminary phase of indistinctness. The process is similar
to the series of impressions that would be got as a statue
was gradually unwrapped from a series of swathings. The
same kind of sequence occurs, although, perhaps, in a very
brief space of time, when one is trying to recall a piece of
music. Every thought is preceded by a kind of half-thought,
a condition in which vague geometrical figures,
shifting masks, a swaying and indistinct background hover
in the mind. The beginning and the end of the whole
process, which I may term &#8220;clarification,&#8221; are what take
place when a short-sighted person proceeds to look through
properly adapted lenses.</p>

<p>Just as this process occurs in the life of the individual
(and he, indeed, may die long before it is complete), so it
occurs in history. Definite scientific conceptions are preceded
by anticipations. The process of clarification is
spread over many generations. There were ancient and
modern vague anticipations of the theory of Darwin and
Lamarck, anticipations which we are now apt to overvalue.
Mayer and Helmholtz had their predecessors, and Goethe
and Leonardo da Vinci, perhaps two of the most many-sided
intellects known to us, anticipated in a vague way many of
the conclusions of modern science. The whole history of
thought is a continuous &#8220;clarification,&#8221; a more and more
accurate description or realisation of details. The enormous
number of stages between light and darkness, the minute
gradations of detail that follow each other in the development
of thought can be realised best if one follows historically
some complicated modern piece of knowledge, such
as, for instance, the theory of elliptical functions.</p>

<p>The process of clarification may be reversed, and the act
of forgetting is such a reversal. This may take a considerable
time, and is usually noticed only by accident at some
point or other of its course. The process is similar to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
gradual obliteration of well-made roads, for the maintenance
of which no provision has been made. The faint anticipations
of a thought are very like the faint recollections of it,
and the latter gradually become blurred as in the case of a
neglected road over the boundaries of which animals stray,
slowly obliterating it. In this connection a practical rule
for memorising, discovered and applied by a friend of mine,
is interesting. It generally happens that if one wants to
learn, say, a piece of music, or a section from the history of
philosophy, one has to go over parts of it again and again.
The problem was, how long should the intervals be between
these successive attempts to commit to memory? The
answer was that they should not be so long as to make it
possible to take a fresh interest in the subject again, to be
interested and curious about it. If the interval has produced
that state of mind, then the process of clarification must begin
from the beginning again. The rather popular physiological
theory of Sigismund Exner as to the formation of &#8220;paths&#8221;
in the nervous system may perhaps be taken as a physical
parallel of the process of clarification. According to the
theory, the nerves, or rather the fibrils, make paths easy for
the stimulations to travel along, if these stimulations last
sufficiently long or are repeated sufficiently often. So also
in the case of forgetting; what happens is that these paths
or processes of the nerve-cells atrophy from disuse. Avenarius
would have explained the above processes by his
theory of the articulation of the fibres of the brain, but his
physical doctrine was rather too crude and too simple for
application to psycho-physics. None the less his conception
of articulation or jointing is both convenient and appropriate
in its application to the process of clarification, and I shall
employ it in that connection.</p>

<p>The process of clarification must be traced thoroughly in
order to realise its importance, but for the moment, it is
important to consider only the initial stage. The distinction
of Avenarius between &#8220;element&#8221; and &#8220;character,&#8221; which
later on will become evident in a process of clarification, is
not applicable to the very earliest moments of the process.<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
It is necessary to coin a name for those minds to which the
duality of element and character becomes appreciable at no
stage of the process. I propose for psychical data at this
earliest stage of their existence the word Henid (from the
Greek &#7953;&#957;, because in them it is impossible to distinguish
perception and sensation as two analytically separable factors,
and because, therefore, there is no trace of duality in them).</p>

<p>Naturally the &#8220;henid&#8221; is an abstract conception and may
not occur in the absolute form. How often psychical data
in human beings actually stand at this absolute extreme of
undifferentiation is uncertain and unimportant; but the
theory does not need to concern itself with the possibility
of such an extreme. A common example from what has
happened to all of us may serve to illustrate what a henid
is. I may have a definite wish to say something particular,
and then something distracts me, and the &#8220;it&#8221; I wanted to
say or think has gone. Later on, by some process of association,
the &#8220;it&#8221; is quite suddenly reproduced, and I know
at once that it was what was on my tongue, but, so to speak,
in a more perfect stage of development.</p>

<p>I fear lest some one may expect me to describe exactly
what I mean by &#8220;henid.&#8221; The wish can come only from a
misconception. The very idea of a henid forbids its description;
it is merely a something. Later on identification
will come with the complete articulation of the contents of
the henid; but the henid is not the whole of this detailed
content, but is distinguished from it by a lower grade of
consciousness, by an absence of, so to speak, relief, by a
blending of the die and the impression, by the absence of
a central point in the field of vision.</p>

<p>And so one cannot describe particular henids; one can
only be conscious of their existence.</p>

<p>None the less henids are things as vital as elements and
characters. Each henid is an individual and can be distinguished
from other henids. Later on I shall show that
probably the mental data of early childhood (certainly of
the first fourteen months) are all henids, although perhaps
not in the absolute sense. Throughout childhood these<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
data do not reach far from the henid stage; in adults there
is always a certain process of development going on.
Probably the perceptions of some plants and animals are
henids. In the case of mankind the development from the
henid to the completely differentiated perception and idea
is always possible, although such an ideal condition may
seldom be attained. Whilst expression in words is impossible
in the case of the absolute henid, as words imply
articulated thoughts, there are also in the highest stages of
the intellect possible to man some things still unclarified
and, therefore, unspeakable.</p>

<p>The theory of henids will help in the old quarrel between
the spheres of perception and sensation, and will replace by
a developmental conception the ideas of element and
character which Avenarius and Petzoldt deduced from the
process of clarification. It is only when the elements
become distinct that they can be distinguished from the
characters. Man is disposed to humours and sentimentalities
only so long as the contours of his ideas are vague;
when he sees things in the light instead of the dark his
process of thinking will become different.</p>

<p>Now what is the relation between the investigation I have
been making and the psychology of the sexes? What is
the distinction between the male and the female (and to
reach this has been the object of my digression) in the
process of clarification?</p>

<p>Here is my answer:</p>

<p>The male has the same psychical data as the female, but
in a more articulated form; where she thinks more or less
in henids, he thinks in more or less clear and detailed presentations
in which the elements are distinct from the tones of
feeling. With the woman, thinking and feeling are identical,
for man they are in opposition. The woman has many of
her mental experiences as henids, whilst in man these have
passed through a process of clarification. Woman is sentimental,
and knows emotion but not mental excitement.</p>

<p>The greater articulation of the mental data in man is
reflected in the more marked character of his body and<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
face, as compared with the roundness and vagueness of the
woman. In the same connection it is to be remembered
that, notwithstanding the popular belief, the senses of the
male are much more acute than those of the woman. The
only exception is the sense of touch, an exception of great
interest to which I shall refer later. It has been established,
moreover, that the sensibility to pain is much more acute in
man, and we have now learned to distinguish between that
and the tactile sensations.</p>

<p>A weaker sensibility is likely to retard the passage of
mental data through the process of clarification, although
we cannot quite take it for granted that it must be so.
Perhaps a more trustworthy proof of the less degree of
articulation in the mental data of the woman may be drawn
from consideration of the greater decision in the judgments
made by men, although indeed it may be the case that this
distinction rests on a deeper basis. It is certainly the case
that whilst we are still near the henid stage we know much
more certainly what a thing is not than what it is. What
Mach has called instinctive experience depends on henids.
While we are near the henid stage we think round about a
subject, correct ourselves at each new attempt, and say that
that was not yet the right word. Naturally that condition
implies uncertainty and indecision in judgment. Judgment
comes towards the end of the process of clarification; the
act of judgment is in itself a departure from the henid stage.</p>

<p>The most decisive proof for the correctness of the view
that attributes henids to woman and differentiated thoughts
to man, and that sees in this a fundamental sexual distinction,
lies in the fact that wherever a new judgment is to be made,
(not merely something already settled to be put into proverbial
form) it is always the case that the female expects
from man the clarification of her data, the interpretation of
her henids. It is almost a tertiary sexual character of the
male, and certainly it acts on the female as such, that she
expects from him the interpretation and illumination of her
thoughts. It is from this reason that so many girls say that
they could only marry, or, at least, only love a man who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
cleverer than themselves; that they would be repelled by a
man who said that all they thought was right, and did not
know better than they did. In short, the woman makes it a
criterion of manliness that the man should be superior to
herself mentally, that she should be influenced and dominated
by the man; and this in itself is enough to ridicule all
ideas of sexual equality.</p>

<p>The male lives consciously, the female lives unconsciously.
This is certainly the necessary conclusion for the extreme
cases. The woman receives her consciousness from the
man; the function to bring into consciousness what was
outside it is a sexual function of the typical man with
regard to the typical woman, and is a necessary part of his
ideal completeness.</p>

<p>And now we are brought up against the problem of
talent; the whole modern woman question appears to be
resolving itself into a dispute as to whether men or women
are more highly gifted. As the question is generally propounded
there is no attempt to distinguish between the
pure types of sex; the conclusions with regard to these that
I have been able to set forth have an important bearing on
the answer to the question.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
TALENT AND GENIUS</h3>

<p>There has been so much written about the nature of genius
that, to avoid misunderstanding, it will be better to make a
few general remarks before going into the subject.</p>

<p>And the first thing to do is to settle the question of
talent. Genius and talent are nearly always connected in
the popular idea, as if the first were a higher, or the highest,
grade of the latter, and as if a man of very high and varied
talents might be a sort of intermediate between the two.
This view is entirely erroneous. Even if there were
different degrees or grades of genius, they would have
absolutely nothing to do with so-called &#8220;talent.&#8221; A
talent, for instance the mathematical talent, may be
possessed by some one in a very high degree from birth;
and he will be able to master the most difficult problems of
that science with ease; but for this he will require no
genius, which is the same as originality, individuality, and
a condition of general productiveness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are men of great genius who
have shown no special talent in any marked degree; for
instance, men like Novalis or Jean Paul. Genius is distinctly
not the superlative of talent; there is a world-wide
difference between the two; they are of absolutely unlike
nature; they can neither be measured by one another or
compared to each other.</p>

<p>Talent is hereditary; it may be the common possession
of a whole family (<i>e.g.</i>, the Bach family); genius is not
transmitted; it is never diffused, but is strictly individual.</p>

<p>Many ill-balanced people, and in particular women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
regard genius and talent as identical. Women, indeed,
have not the faculty of appreciating genius, although this
is not the common view. Any extravagance that distinguishes
a man from other men appeals equally to their
sexual ambition; they confuse the dramatist with the actor,
and make no distinction between the virtuoso and the artist.
For them the talented man is the man of genius, and
Nietzsche is the type of what they consider genius. What
has been called the French type of thought, which so
strongly appeals to them, has nothing to do with the
highest possibilities of the mind. Great men take themselves
and the world too seriously to become what is called
merely intellectual. Men who are merely intellectual are
insincere; they are people who have never really been
deeply engrossed by things and who do not feel an overpowering
desire for production. All that they care about is
that their work should glitter and sparkle like a well-cut
stone, not that it should illuminate anything. They are
more occupied with what will be said of what they think
than by the thoughts themselves. There are men who are
willing to marry a woman they do not care about merely
because she is admired by other men. Such a relation
exists between many men and their thoughts. I cannot
help thinking of one particular living author, a blaring,
outrageous person, who fancies that he is roaring when he
is only snarling. Unfortunately, Nietzsche (however
superior he is to the man I have in mind) seems to have
devoted himself chiefly to what he thought would shock
the public. He is at his best when he is most unmindful
of effect. His was the vanity of the mirror, saying to what
it reflects, &#8220;See how faithfully I show you your image.&#8221;
In youth when a man is not yet certain of himself he may
try to secure his own position by jostling others. Great
men, however, are painfully aggressive only from necessity.
They are not like a girl who is most pleased about a new
dress because she knows that it will annoy her friends.</p>

<p>Genius! genius! how much mental disturbance and discomfort,
hatred and envy, jealousy and pettiness, has it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
aroused in the majority of men, and how much counterfeit
and tinsel has the desire for it not occasioned?</p>

<p>I turn gladly from the imitations of genius to the thing
itself and its true embodiment. But where can I begin?
All the qualities that go to make genius are in so intimate
connection that to begin with any one of them seems to
lead to premature conclusions.</p>

<p>All discussions on the nature of genius are either biological-clinical,
and serve only to show the absurd presumption
of present knowledge of this kind in its hope to solve a
problem so difficult; or they descend from the heights of a
metaphysical system for the sole purpose of including
genius in their purview. If the road that I am about to
take does not lead to every goal at once, it is only because
that is the nature of roads.</p>

<p>Consider how much deeper a great poet can reach into
the nature of man than an average person. Think of the
extraordinary number of characters depicted by Shakespeare
or Euripides, or the marvellous assortment of human beings
that fill the pages of Zola. After the Penthesilea, Heinrich
von Kleist created K&auml;tchen von Heilbronn, and Michael
Angelo embodied from his imagination the Delphic Sibyls
and the Leda. There have been few men so little devoted
to art as Kant and Schelling, and yet these have written
most profoundly and truly about it. In order to depict a
man one must understand him, and to understand him one
must be like him; in order to portray his psychological
activities one must be able to reproduce them in oneself.
To understand a man one must have his nature in oneself.
One must be like the mind one tries to grasp. It takes a
thief to know a thief, and only an innocent man can understand
another innocent man. The poseur only understands
other poseurs, and sees nothing but pose in the actions of
others; whilst the simple-minded fails to understand the
most flagrant pose. To understand a man is really to be
that man.</p>

<p>It would seem to follow that a man can best understand
himself&mdash;a conclusion plainly absurd. No one can understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
himself, for to do that he would have to get outside
himself; the subject of the knowing and willing activity
would have to become its own object. To grasp the
universe it would be necessary to get a standpoint outside
the universe, and the possibility of such a standpoint is
incompatible with the idea of a universe. He who could
understand himself could understand the world. I do not
make the statement merely as an explanation: it contains
an important truth, to the significance of which I shall
recur. For the present I am content to assert that no one
can understand his deepest, most intimate nature. This
happens in actual practice; when one wishes to understand
in a general way, it is always from other persons, never
from oneself, that one gets one&#8217;s materials. The other
person chosen must be similar in some respect, however
different as a whole; and, making use of this similarity, he
can recognise, represent, comprehend. So far as one understands
a man, one is that man.</p>

<p>The man of genius takes his place in the above argument
as he who understands incomparably more other beings
than the average man. Goethe is said to have said of himself
that there was no vice or crime of which he could not
trace the tendency in himself, and that at some period of
his life he could not have understood fully. The genius,
therefore, is a more complicated, more richly endowed,
more varied man; and a man is the closer to being a
genius the more men he has in his personality, and the
more really and strongly he has these others within him.
If comprehension of those about him only flickers in him
like a poor candle, then he is unable, like the great poet, to
kindle a mighty flame in his heroes, to give distinction and
character to his creations. The ideal of an artistic genius
is to live in all men, to lose himself in all men, to reveal
himself in multitudes; and so also the aim of the
philosopher is to discover all others in himself, to fuse
them into a unit which is his own unit.</p>

<p>This protean character of genius is no more simultaneous
than the bi-sexuality of which I have spoken. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
greatest genius cannot understand the nature of all men at
the same time, on one and the same day. The comprehensive
and manifold rudiments which a man possesses in
his mind can develop only slowly and by degrees with the
gradual unfolding of his whole life. It appears almost as if
there were a definite periodicity in his development. These
periods, when they recur, however, are not exactly alike;
they are not mere repetitions, but are intensifications of
their predecessors, on a higher plane. No two moments in
the life of an individual are exactly alike; there is between
the later and the earlier periods only the similarity of
the higher and lower parts of a spiral ascent. Thus
it has frequently happened that famous men have conceived
a piece of work in their early youth, laid it aside
during manhood, and resumed and completed it in old age.
Periods exist in every man, but in different degrees and
with varying &#8220;amplitude.&#8221; Just as the genius is the man
who contains in himself the greatest number of others in
the most active way, so the amplitude of a man&#8217;s periods
will be the greater the wider his mental relations may be.
Illustrious men have often been told, by their teachers, in
their youth &#8220;that they were always in one extreme or
another.&#8221; As if they could be anything else! These
transitions in the case of unusual men often assume the
character of a crisis. Goethe once spoke of the &#8220;recurrence
of puberty&#8221; in an artist. The idea is obviously to be
associated with the matter under discussion.</p>

<p>It results from their periodicity that, in men of genius,
sterile years precede productive years, these again to be
followed by sterility, the barren periods being marked by
psychological self-depreciation, by the feeling that they
are less than other men; times in which the remembrance
of the creative periods is a torment, and when they envy
those who go about undisturbed by such penalties. Just as
his moments of ecstasy are more poignant, so are the
periods of depression of a man of genius more intense than
those of other men. Every great man has such periods, of
longer or shorter duration, times in which he loses self-confidence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
in which he thinks of suicide; times in which,
indeed, he may be sowing the seeds of a future harvest, but
which are devoid of the stimulus to production; times
which call forth the blind criticisms &#8220;How such a genius
is degenerating!&#8221; &#8220;How he has played himself out!&#8221;
&#8220;How he repeats himself!&#8221; and so forth.</p>

<p>It is just the same with other characteristics of the man
of genius. Not only the material, but also the spirit, of his
work is subject to periodic change. At one time he is inclined
to a philosophical and scientific view; at another
time the artistic influence is strongest; at one time his
intervals are altogether in the direction of history and the
growth of civilisation; later on it is &#8220;nature&#8221; (compare
Nietzsche&#8217;s &#8220;Studies in Infinity&#8221; with his &#8220;Zarathustra&#8221;);
at another time he is a mystic, at yet another simplicity
itself! (Bj&ouml;rnson and Maurice Maeterlinck are good modern
examples.) In fact, the &#8220;amplitude&#8221; of the periods of famous
men is so great, the different revelations of their nature so
various, so many different individuals appear in them, that
the periodicity of their mental life may be taken almost as
diagnostic. I must make a remark sufficiently obvious
from all this, as to the existence of almost incredibly great
changes in the personal appearance of men of genius from
time to time. Comparison of the portraits at different
times of Goethe, Beethoven, Kant, or Schopenhauer are
enough to establish this. The number of different aspects
that the face of a man has assumed may be taken almost as
a physiognomical measure of his talent.<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote9"><a href="#FNanchor9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
I cannot help using the word &#8220;talent&#8221; from time to time
when I really mean genius; but I wish it to be remembered that I
am convinced of the existence of a fundamental distinction between
&#8220;talent,&#8221; or &#8220;giftedness,&#8221; and &#8220;genius.&#8221;</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>People with an unchanging expression are low in the
intellectual scale. Physiognomists, therefore, must not be
surprised that men of genius, in whose faces a new side of
their minds is continually being revealed, are difficult to
classify, and that their individualities leave little permanent
mark on their features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>It is possible that my introductory description of genius
will be repudiated indignantly, because it would imply that
a Shakespeare has the vulgarity of his Falstaff, the rascality
of his Iago, the boorishness of his Caliban, and because it
identifies great men with all the low and contemptible
things that they have described. As a matter of fact, men
of genius do conform to my description, and as their
biographies show, are liable to the strangest passions and
the most repulsive instincts. And yet the objection is
invalid, as the fuller exposition of the thesis will reveal.
Only the most superficial survey of the argument could
support it, whilst the exactly opposite conclusion is a much
more likely inference. Zola, who has so faithfully described
the impulse to commit murder, did not himself
commit a murder, because there were so many other
characters in him. The actual murderer is in the grasp of
his own disposition: the author describing the murder is
swayed by a whole kingdom of impulses. Zola would
know the desire for murder much better than the actual
murderer would know it, he would recognise it in himself,
if it really came to the surface in him, and he would be
prepared for it. In such ways the criminal instincts in great
men are intellectualised and turned to artistic purposes as
in the case of Zola, or to philosophic purposes as with
Kant, but not to actual crime.</p>

<p>The presence of a multitude of possibilities in great men
has important consequences connected with the theory of
henids that I elaborated in the last chapter. A man understands
what he already has within himself much more
quickly than what is foreign to him (were it otherwise there
would be no intercourse possible: as it is we do not realise
how often we fail to understand one another). To the
genius, who understands so much more than the average
man, much more will be apparent.</p>

<p>The schemer will readily recognise his fellow; an impassioned
player easily reads the same power in another
person; whilst those with no special powers will observe
nothing. Art discerns itself best, as Wagner said. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
case of complex personalities the matter stands thus: one
of these can understand other men better than they can
understand themselves, because within himself he has not
only the character he is grasping, but also its opposite.
Duality is necessary for observation and comprehension; if
we inquire from psychology what is the most necessary
condition for becoming conscious of a thing, for grasping
it, we shall find the answer in &#8220;contrast.&#8221; If everything
were a uniform grey we should have no idea of colour;
absolute unison of sound would soon produce sleep in all
mankind; duality, the power which can differentiate, is the
origin of the alert consciousness. Thus it happens that no
one can understand himself were he to think of nothing
else all his life, but he can understand another to whom he
is partly alike, and from whom he is also partly quite
different. Such a distribution of qualities is the condition
most favourable for understanding. In short, to understand
a man means to have equal parts of himself and of his
opposite in one.</p>

<p>That things must be present in pairs of contrasts if we
are to be conscious of one member of the pair is shown by
the facts of colour-vision. Colour-blindness always extends
to the complementary colours. Those who are red blind
are also green blind; those who are blind to blue have no
consciousness of yellow. This law holds good for all
mental phenomena; it is a fundamental condition of consciousness.
The most high-spirited people understand and
experience depression much more than those who are of
level disposition. Any one with so keen a sense of delicacy
and subtilty as Shakespeare must also be capable of extreme
grossness.</p>

<p>The more types and their contrasts a man unites in his
own mind the less will escape him, since observation follows
comprehension, and the more he will see and understand
what other men feel, think, and wish. There has never
been a genius who was not a great discerner of men. The
great man sees through the simpler man often at a glance,
and would be able to characterise him completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span></p>

<p>Most men have this, that, or the other faculty or sense
disproportionately developed. One man knows all the birds
and tells their different voices most accurately. Another
has a love for plants and is devoted to botany from his
childhood. One man pores lovingly into the many layered
rocks of the earth, and has only the vaguest appreciation of
the skies; to another the attraction of cold, star-sown
space is supreme. One man is repelled by the mountains
and seeks the restless sea; another, like Nietzsche, gets no
help from the tossing waters and hungers for the peace of
the hills. Every man, however simple he may be, has some
side of nature with which he is in special sympathy and for
which his faculties are specially alert. And so the ideal
genius, who has all men within him, has also all their
preferences and all their dislikes. There is in him not only
the universality of men, but of all nature. He is the man to
whom all things tell their secrets, to whom most happens,
and whom least escapes. He understands most things, and
those most deeply, because he has the greatest number of
things to contrast and compare them with. The genius is
he who is conscious of most, and of that most acutely. And
so without doubt his sensations must be most acute; but
this must not be understood as implying, say, in the artist
the keenest power of vision, in the composer the most
acute hearing; the measure of genius is not to be taken
from the acuteness of the sense organ but from that of the
perceiving brain.</p>

<p>The consciousness of the genius is, then, the furthest
removed from the henid stage. It has the greatest, most
limpid clearness and distinctness. In this way genius
declares itself to be a kind of higher masculinity, and thus
the female cannot be possessed of genius. The conclusion
of this chapter and the last is simply that the life of the
male is a more highly conscious life than that of the female,
and genius is identical with the highest and widest consciousness.
This extremely comprehensive consciousness
of the highest types of mankind is due to the enormous
number of contrasting elements in their natures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span></p>

<p>Universality is the distinguishing mark of genius. There
is no such thing as a special genius, a genius for mathematics,
or for music, or even for chess, but only a universal
genius. The genius is a man who knows everything without
having learned it.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that this infinite knowledge does not
include theories and systems which have been formulated
by science from facts, neither the history of the Spanish
war of succession nor experiments in dia-magnetism.</p>

<p>The artist does not acquire his knowledge of the colours
reflected on water by cloudy or sunny skies, by a course of
optics, any more than it requires a deep study of characterology
to judge other men. But the more gifted a man is,
the more he has studied on his own account, and the more
subjects he has made his own.</p>

<p>The theory of special genius, according to which, for
instance, it is supposed that a musical &#8220;genius&#8221; should be
a fool at other subjects, confuses genius with talent. A
musician, if truly great, is just as well able to be universal
in his knowledge as a philosopher or a poet. Such an
one was Beethoven. On the other hand, a musician may
be as limited in the sphere of his activity as any average
man of science. Such an one was Johann Strauss, who,
in spite of his beautiful melodies, cannot be regarded
as a genius if only because of the absence of constructive
faculty in him. To come back to the main point;
there are many kinds of talent, but only one kind of genius,
and that is able to choose any kind of talent and master it.
There is something in genius common to all those who
possess it; however much difference there may seem to be
between the great philosopher, painter, musician, poet, or
religious teacher. The particular talent through the medium
of which the spirit of a man develops is of less importance
than has generally been thought. The limits of the
different arts can easily be passed, and much besides native
inborn gifts have to be taken into account. The history of
one art should be studied along with the history of other
arts, and in that way many obscure events might be explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
It is outside my present purpose, however, to go
into the question of what determines a genius to become,
say, a mystic, or, say, a great delineator.</p>

<p>From genius itself, the common quality of all the different
manifestations of genius, woman is debarred. I will discuss
later as to whether such things are possible as pure scientific
or technical genius as well as artistic and philosophical
genius. There is good reason for a greater exactness in the
use of the word. But that may come, and however clearly
we may yet be able to describe it woman will have to be
excluded from it. I am glad that the course of my inquiry
has been such as to make it impossible for me to be charged
with having framed such a definition of genius as necessarily
to exclude woman from it.</p>

<p>I may now sum up the conclusions of this chapter.
Whilst woman has no consciousness of genius, except as
manifested in one particular person, who imposes his
personality on her, man has a deep capacity for realising it,
a capacity which Carlyle, in his still little understood book
on &#8220;Hero-Worship,&#8221; has described so fully and permanently.
In &#8220;Hero-Worship,&#8221; moreover, the idea is definitely
insisted on that genius is linked with manhood, that it
represents an ideal masculinity in the highest form. Woman
has no direct consciousness of it; she borrows a kind of
imperfect consciousness from man. Woman, in short, has
an unconscious life, man a conscious life, and the genius
the most conscious life.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER V</span><br />
TALENT AND MEMORY</h3>

<p>The following observation bears on my henid theory:</p>

<p>I made a note, half mechanically, of a page in a botanical
work from which later on I was going to make an extract.
Something was in my mind in henid form. What I thought,
how I thought it, what was then knocking at the door of my
consciousness, I could not remember a minute afterwards,
in spite of the hardest effort. I take this case as a typical
example of the henid.</p>

<p>The more deeply impressed, the more detailed a complex
perception may be the more easily does it reproduce itself.
Clearness of the consciousness is the preliminary condition
for remembering, and the memory of the mental stimulation
is proportional to the intensity of the consciousness. &#8220;I
shall not forget that&#8221;; &#8220;I shall remember that all my life&#8221;;
&#8220;That will never escape my memory again.&#8221; Such phrases
men use when things have made a deep impression on
them, of moments in which they have gained wisdom or
have become richer by an important experience. As the
power of being reproduced is directly proportionate to the
organisation of a mental impression, it is clear that there
can be no recollection of an absolute henid.</p>

<p>As the mental endowment of a man varies with the
organisation of his accumulated experiences, the better
endowed he is, the more readily will he be able to remember
his whole past, everything that he has ever thought or heard,
seen or done, perceived or felt, the more completely in fact
will he be able to reproduce his whole life. Universal
remembrance of all its experiences, therefore, is the sure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
most general, and most easily proved mark of a genius. If
a common theory, especially popular with the philosophers
of the coffee-house, be true, that productive men (because
they are always covering new ground) have no memory, it
is often because they are productive only from being on
new ground.</p>

<p>The great extent and acuteness of the memory of men of
genius, which I propose to lay down dogmatically as a
necessary inference from my theory, without attempting to
prove it further, is not incompatible with their rapid loss of
the facts impressed on them in school, the tables of Greek
verbs, and so forth. Their memory is of what they have
experienced, not of what they have learned. Of all that
was acquired for examination purposes only so much will
be retained as was in harmony with the natural talent of
the pupil. Thus a house-painter may have a better memory
for colours than a great philosopher; the most narrow
philologist may remember Greek aorists that he has learned
by heart better than his teacher, who may none the less be
a great poet. The uselessness of the experimental school of
psychology (notwithstanding their marvellous arsenal of
instruments of experimental precision) is shown by their
expectation of getting results as to memory from tests with
letters, unconnected words, long rows of figures. These
experiments have so little bearing on the true memory of
man, on the memory by which he recalls the experiences of
his life, that one wonders if such psychologists have realised
that such a thing as the mind exists. The customary
experiments place the most different subjects under the
same conditions, pay no attention to the individuality of
these subjects, and treat them merely as good or bad
registering apparatus. There is a parable in the fact that
the two German words &#8220;bemerken&#8221; (take notice of)
and &#8220;merken&#8221; (remember) come from the same root.
Only what is harmonious with some inborn quality will be
retained. When a man remembers a thing, it is because he
was capable of taking some interest in the thing; when he
forgets, it is because he was uninterested. The religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
man will surely and exactly remember texts, the poet verses
and the mathematician equations.</p>

<p>This brings us in another fashion to the subject of the
last chapter, and to another reason for the great memories
of genius. The more significant a man is, the more different
personalities he unites in himself, the more interests that
are contained in him, the more wide his memory must be.
All men have practically the same opportunities of perception,
but the vast majority of men apprehend only an
infinitesimal part of what they have perceived. The ideal
genius is one in whom perception and apprehension are
identical in their field. Of course no such being actually
exists. On the other hand, there is no man who has apprehended
nothing that he has perceived. In this way we
may take it that all degrees of genius (not talent) exist; no
male is quite without a trace of genius. Complete genius
is an ideal; no man is absolutely without the quality, and
no man possesses it completely. Apprehension or absorption,
and memory or retention, vary together in their extent
and their permanence. There is an uninterrupted gradation
from the man whose mentality is unconnected from moment
to moment, and to whom no incidents can signify anything
because there is within him nothing to compare them with
(such an extreme, of course, does not exist) to the fully
developed minds for which everything is unforgettable,
because of the firm impressions made and the sureness with
which they are absorbed. The extreme of genius also does
not exist, because even the greatest genius is not wholly a
genius at every moment of his life.</p>

<p>What is at once a deduction from the necessary connection
between memory and genius, and a proof of the
actuality of the connection, lies in the extraordinary
memory for minute details shown by the man of genius.
Because of the universality of his mind, everything has
only one interpretation for him, an interpretation often
unsuspected at the time; and so things cling obstinately
in his memory and remain there inextinguishably, although
he may have taken not the smallest trouble to take note of<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
them. And so one may almost take as another mark of the
genius that the phrase &#8220;this is no longer true&#8221; has no
meaning for him. There is nothing that is no longer true
for him, probably just because he has a clearer idea than
other men of the changes that come with time.</p>

<p>The following appears to be one of the best means for
the objective examination of the endowment of a man: If
after a long separation from him we resume the new intercourse
with the circumstances of the last, then we shall
find that the highly endowed man has forgotten nothing,
that he vividly and completely takes up the subject from
where it was left off with the fullest recollection of the
details. How much ordinary men forget of their lives
any one can prove to his astonishment and horror. It may
happen that we have been for hours importantly engaged
with a man a few weeks before, and we may find that he
has forgotten all about it. It is true that if one recalls all
the circumstances to his mind, he begins to remember, and,
finally, with sufficient help, may remember almost completely.
Such experience has made me think that there
may be an empirical proof of the hypothesis that no absolute
forgetting ever occurs; that if the right method with
the individual be chosen recollection may always be
induced.</p>

<p>It follows also that from one&#8217;s own experience, from
what one has thought or said, heard or read, felt or done,
one can give the smallest possible to another, that the other
does not already know. Consideration of the amount that
a man can take in from another would seem to serve as a
sort of objective measure of his genius, a measure that
does not have to wait for an estimation of his actual
creative efforts. I am not going to discuss the extent to
which this theory opposes current views on education, but
I recommend parents and teachers to pay attention to it.
The extent to which a man can detect differences and
resemblances must depend on his memories. This faculty
will be best developed in those whose past permeates their
present, all the moments of the life of whom are amalgamated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
Such persons will have the greatest opportunities
of detecting resemblances and so finding the material for
comparisons. They will always seize hold of from the past
what has the greatest resemblance to the present experience,
and the two experiences will be combined in such a way
that no similarities or differences will be concealed. And
so they are able to maintain the past against the influence
of the present. It is not without reason that from time
immemorial the special merit of poetry has been considered
to be its richness in beautiful comparisons and pictures, or
that we turn to again and again, or await our favourite
images with impatience when we read Homer or Shakespeare
or Klopstock. To-day when, for the first time for
a century and a half, Germany is without great poets or
painters, and when none the less it is impossible to find
any one who is not an &#8220;author,&#8221; the power of clear and
beautiful comparison seems to have gone. A period the
nature of which can best be described in vague and dubious
words, the philosophy of which has become in more than
one sense the philosophy of the unconscious can contain
nothing great. Consciousness is the mark of greatness, and
before it the unconscious is dispersed as the sun disperses
a mist. If only consciousness were to come to this age,
how quickly voices that are now famous would become
silent. It is only in full consciousness, in which the
experience of the present assumes greater intensity by its
union with all the experiences of the past, that imagination,
the necessary quality for all philosophical as for all artistic
effort, can find a place. It is untrue, therefore, that women
have more imagination than men. The experiences on
account of which men have assigned higher powers of
imagination to women come entirely from the imaginative
sexual life of women. The only inferences that can be
drawn from this do not belong to the present section of my
work.</p>

<p>The absence of women from the history of music must
be referred to deeper causes; but it also supports my contention
that women are devoid of imagination. To produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
music requires a great deal more imagination than the
malest woman possesses, and much more than is required
for other kinds of artistic or for scientific effort. There
is nothing in nature, nothing in the sphere of the senses,
corresponding directly with sound pictures. Music has no
relation to the world of experience; there is no &#8220;music,&#8221;
no chords or melodies in the natural world; these have to
be evolved from the imagination of the composer. Every
other art has more definite relations to empirical art. Even
architecture, which has been compared with music, has
definite relations to matter, although, like music, it has no
anticipations in the senses. Architecture, too, is an entirely
masculine occupation. The very idea of a female architect
excites compassion.</p>

<p>The so-called stupefying effect of music on the creative
or practical musician (especially instrumental music)
depends on the fact that even the sense of smell is a
better guide to man in the world of experience than the
contents of a musical work. And it is just this complete
absence of all relation to the world of sight, taste, and smell,
that makes music specially unfitted to express the female
nature. It also explains why this peculiarity of his art
demands the highest grade of imagination from a musician,
and why those to whom musical compositions &#8220;come&#8221;
seem stranger to their fellow men than painters or sculptors.
The so-called &#8220;imagination&#8221; of women must be very
different from that of men, since there is no woman with
even the same position in the history of music that Angelica
Kaufmann had in art.</p>

<p>Where anything obviously depends on strong moulding
women have not the smallest leaning towards its production,
neither in philosophy nor in music, in the plastic arts nor in
architecture. Where, however, a weak and vague sentimentality
can be expressed with little effort, as in painting
or verse-making, or in pseudo-mysticism and theosophy,
women have sought and found a suitable field for their
efforts. Their lack of productiveness in the former sphere
is in harmony with the vagueness of the psychical life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
women. Music is the nearest possible approach to the
organisation of a sensation. Nothing is more definite,
characteristic, and impressive than a melody, nothing that
will more strongly resist obliteration. One remembers
much longer what is sung than what is spoken, and the arias
better than the recitatives.</p>

<p>Let us note specially here that the usual phrases of the
defenders of women do not apply to the case of women.
Music is not one of the arts to which women have had
access only so recently that it is too soon to expect fruits;
from the remotest antiquity women have sung and played.
And yet....</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that even in the case of drawing
and painting women have now had opportunities for at
least two centuries. Every one knows how many girls learn
to draw and sketch, and it cannot be said that there has not
yet been time for results were results possible. As there are
so few female painters with the smallest importance in the
history of art, it must be that there is something in the
nature of things against it. As a matter of fact, the painting
and etching of women is no more than a sort of elegant,
luxurious handiwork. The sensuous, physical element of
colour is more suitable for them than the intellectual work
of formal line-drawing, and hence it is, that whereas women
have acquired some small distinction in painting they have
gained none in drawing. The power of giving form to
chaos is with those in whom the most universal memory
has made the widest comprehension possible; it is a quality
of the masculine genius.</p>

<p>I regret that I must so continually use the word genius, as
if that should apply only to a caste as well defined from those
below as income-tax payers are from the untaxed. The word
genius was very probably invented by a man who had small
claims on it himself; greater men would have understood
better what to be a genius really was, and probably they
would have come to see that the word could be applied to
most people. Goethe said that perhaps only a genius is able
to understand a genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span></p>

<p>There are probably very few people who have not at some
time of their lives had some quality of genius. If they have
not had such, it is probable that they have also been without
great sorrow or great pain. They would have needed only
to live sufficiently intently for a time for some quality to
reveal itself. The poems of first love are a case in point,
and certainly such love is a sufficient stimulus.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that quite ordinary men in
moments of excitement, in anger at some underhanded deed,
have found words with which they never would have been
credited. The greater part of what is called expression in
art as in language depends (if the reader will remember what
I have said about the process of &#8220;clarification&#8221;) on the fact
that some individual more richly endowed clarifies, organises,
and exhibits some idea almost instantaneously, an idea which
to a less endowed person was still in the henid form. The
course of clarification is much shortened in the mind of the
second person.</p>

<p>If it really were the case, as popular opinion has tried to
establish, that the genius were separated from ordinary men
by a thick wall through which no sound could penetrate,
then all understanding of the efforts of genius would be
denied to ordinary men, and their works would fail to make
any impression on them. All hopes of progress depend on
this being untrue. And it is untrue. The difference between
men of genius and the others is quantitative not
qualitative, of degree not of kind.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, very little sense in preventing young
people from giving expression to their ideas on the pretext
that they have less experience than have older persons.
There are many who may live a thousand years without
encountering experience of any value. It could only be in
a society of persons equally gifted that such an idea could
have any meaning.</p>

<p>Because the life of the genius is more intense even in his
earliest years than that of other children, his memory can
go further back. In extreme cases the memory may be
complete and vivid back to the third year of life, whereas<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
in most recollection begins much later. I know some
people whose earliest recollections date only from their
eighth year, and there are instances of an even later beginning
of the conscious life. I do not maintain that the date
at which active memory begins can be taken as a measure of
relative genius, that he who remembers from his second
year is so much the more of a genius than he who can go
back only to his fourth or fifth year. But in a general way,
I believe the parallel to hold good.</p>

<p>Even in the cases of the greatest men, some time, greater
or shorter, elapsed between the date of their earliest recollection
and the time from which onwards they remember
everything, from the time, in fact, in which their genius was
ripe. But in the case of most men there is forgetfulness of
the greater part of their lives; they are conscious only that
they themselves and none other have lived their lives. Out
of their whole lives there only remain certain moments, and
scattered recollections, which serve as sign-posts. If they are
asked about any particular thing they can only tell, for instance,
because in such and such a month they were so old,
or they wore such and such clothes, they lived at this place,
or that their income was so much.</p>

<p>If one has lived with them in former years, it is only after
great trouble that the past can be brought to their mind.
In such cases one is surely justified in saying that such a
person is ungifted, or at least in not considering him conspicuously
able.</p>

<p>The request for an autobiography would put most men
into a most painful position; they could scarcely tell if they
were asked what they had done the day before. Memory
with most people is quite spasmodic and purely associative.
In the case of the man of genius every impression that he has
received endures; he is always under the influence of
impressions; and so nearly all men of genius tend to suffer
from fixed ideas. The psychical condition of men&#8217;s minds
may be compared with a set of bells close together, and so
arranged that in the ordinary man a bell rings only when
one beside it sounds, and the vibration lasts only a moment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
In the genius, when a bell sounds it vibrates so strongly
that it sets in action the whole series, and remains in action
throughout life. The latter kind of movement often gives
rise to extraordinary conditions and absurd impulses, that
may last for weeks together and that form the basis of the
supposed kinship of genius with insanity.</p>

<p>For similar reasons gratitude is apparently the rarest
human virtue. People are often very conscious of how much
they have borrowed, but they neither can nor will try to
remember the necessity in which they stood, nor the freedom
which that help brought them. Even if want of
memory were really the cause of ingratitude, it would not
be sufficient for a man to possess a marvellous memory to
have a like spirit of gratitude. A special condition is also
necessary, but its description cannot be undertaken here.</p>

<p>From the connection between giftedness and memory
which is so often mistaken and denied because it is not
sought where it is to be found, from the power of self recollection,
a further fact is to be deduced. The poet who feels
urged to write without premeditation, without reflection,
without having willingly pressed the pedal; the musician to
whom the desire to compose has come, so that he must
create whether he will or no, even if he feels more inclined
to sleep or to rest; these, in such moments, will simply
reproduce thoughts they have carried in their heads all their
lives. A composer who can remember none of his songs or
subjects by heart, or a poet who cannot recollect any of his
poems&mdash;without having carefully learned them&mdash;such men
are in no sense really great.</p>

<p>Before we apply these remarks to the consideration of the
mental differences of the sexes, we must make yet one
more distinction between different kinds of memory. The
individual moments in the life of a gifted man are not
remembered as disconnected points, not as different
particles of time, each one separated and defined from the
following one, as the numerals one, two, and so on.</p>

<p>The result of self-observation shows that sleep, the
limitations of consciousness, the gaps in memory, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
special experiences, appear to be in some mysterious way
one great whole; incidents do not follow each other like
the tickings of a watch, but they pass along in a single
unbroken stream. With ordinary men the moments which
are united in a close continuity out of the original discrete
multiplicity are very few, and the course of their lives
resembles a little brook, whereas with the genius it is more
like a mighty river into which all the little rivulets flow from
afar; that is to say, the universal comprehension of genius
vibrates to no experience in which all the individual
moments have not been gathered up and stored.</p>

<p>This peculiar continuity by which a man first realises that
he exists, that he is, and that he is in the world, is all
comprehensive in the genius, limited to a few important
moments in the mediocre, <i>and altogether lacking in woman</i>.
When a woman looks back over her life and lives again her
experiences, there is presented no continuous, unbroken
stream, but only a few scattered points. And what kind of
points? They are just those which accord with woman&#8217;s
natural instincts. Of what these interests exclusively consist
the second chapter gave a preliminary idea; and those who
remember the ideas in question will not be astonished at the
following facts: The female is concerned altogether with
one class of recollections&mdash;those connected with the sexual
impulse and reproduction. She thinks of her lovers and
proposals, of her marriage day, of every child as if it were
a doll; of the flowers which she received at every ball,
the number, size, and price of the bouquets; of every
serenade; of every verse which (as she fondly imagines) was
written for her; of every phrase by which a lover has impressed
her; but above all&mdash;with an exactness which is as
contemptible as it is disquieting to herself&mdash;of every
compliment without exception that has ever been paid her.</p>

<p>That is <i>all</i> that the <i>real</i> woman recalls of her life. But
it is just those things which human beings never forget, and
those they cannot remember that give the clue to knowledge
of their life and character. It belongs to a later period of
the book to go more thoroughly into the reason why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
female has precisely the remembrances she has. Some
important conclusion may be expected from reflection on
the incredible memory with which women recall all the
adulation and flattery, all the proofs of gallantry, which
have happened to them since childhood.</p>

<p>Whatever may be urged against the present complete
limitation of the female memory to the sphere of sexuality
and conjugal life, it is to me quite evident. Various
arguments about girls&#8217; schools, and so forth, I am prepared
for. These difficulties will have to be cleared away later.
But I must just say again that all memory, which is to be
used as a means of psychological definition of the individual,
can include only the memory of what has been learnt when
learning means actual experience.</p>

<p>The explanation of the discontinuity in the psychical life
of women (reference to which is introduced here, only
because it is a necessary psychological factor in the problem
of memory, and without reference to its spiritualistic or
idealistic significance) can be reached only when the nature
of continuity is studied with reference to the deepest
problems of philosophy and psychology.</p>

<p>As a proof of the fact I will at present quote nothing more
than the statement of Lotze, which has so often caused
astonishment, that women much more readily submit themselves
to new relationships and more easily accommodate
themselves to them than men, in whom the parvenu can be
seen much longer, whereas one might not be able to tell the
peasant from the peeress, the woman brought up in poor
surroundings from the patrician&#8217;s daughter. Later on I
shall deal more exhaustively with this subject.</p>

<p>At any rate, it will now be seen why (if neither vanity,
desire for gossip, nor imitation drives them to it) only the
better men write down recollections of their lives, and how
I perceive in this a strong evidence of the connection
between memory and giftedness. It is not as if every man
of genius wished to write an autobiography: the incitement
to autobiography comes from special, very deep-seated
psychological conditions. But on the other hand, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
writing of a full autobiography, if it is the outcome of a
genuine desire, is always the sign of a superior man. For
real faithful memory is the source of reverence. The really
great would resist any temptation to give up his past in
exchange for material advantage or mental health; the
greatest treasures of the world, even happiness itself, he
would not take in exchange for his memories.</p>

<p>The desire for a draught of the waters of Lethe is the
trait of mediocre or inferior natures. And however much a
really great man, as Goethe says, may condemn and abhor
his past failings, and although he sees others clinging fast to
theirs, he will never smile at those past actions and failings
of his own, or make merry over his early mode of life and
thought.</p>

<p>The class of persons, now so much in evidence, who
claim to have &#8220;conquered&#8221; their pasts, have the smallest
possible claim to the word &#8220;conquer.&#8221; They are those who
idly relate that they formerly believed this or the other, but
have now &#8220;overcome&#8221; their beliefs, whereas they are as
little in earnest about the present as they were about the
past. They see only the mechanism, not the soul of things,
and at no stage what they believe themselves to have
conquered was deep in their natures.</p>

<p>In contrast with these it may be noticed with what painful
care great men render even the, apparently, most minute
details in their own biographies: for them the past and
present are equal; with others neither of the two are real.</p>

<p>The famous man realises how everything, even the
smallest, most secondary, matters played an important part
in his life, how they have helped his development, and to this
fact is due his extraordinary reverence for his own memoirs.
And such an autobiography is not written all at once, as it
were, with one event treated like another, and without
meditation; nor does the idea of it suddenly occur to a
man; the material for such a work by a great man, so to
speak, is always at hand.</p>

<p>His new experiences acquire a deeper significance because
of the past, which is always present to him, and hence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
great man and only the great man, feels that he himself is in
very truth a &#8220;man of destiny.&#8221; And so it comes that great
men are always more &#8220;superstitious&#8221; than average men.
To sum up, I may say:</p>

<p>A man is himself important precisely in proportion that
all things seem important to him.</p>

<p>In the course of further investigation this dictum will be
seen to have a deep significance even apart from its bearing
on the universality, comprehension, and comparison exhibited
by the genius.</p>

<p>The position of woman in these matters is not difficult to
explain. A real woman never becomes conscious of a destiny,
of her own destiny; she is not heroic; she fights most
for her possessions, and there is nothing tragic in the struggle
as her own fate is decided with the fate of her possessions.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as woman is without continuity, she can have
no true reverence; as a fact, reverence is a purely male
virtue. A man is first reverent about himself, and self-respect
is the first stage in reverence for all things. But it
costs a woman very little to break off with her past; if the
word irony could be fittingly used here, one might say that
a man does not easily regard his past with irony and
superiority as women appear to do&mdash;and not only after
marriage.</p>

<p>Later on I shall show how women are exactly the opposite
of that which reverence means. I would rather be silent
about the reverence of widows.</p>

<p>The superstition of women is psychologically absolutely
different from the superstitions of famous men.</p>

<p>The reverent relation to one&#8217;s own past, which depends
on a real continuity of memory, and which is possible only
by comprehension, can be shown in relation to a still wider
and deeper subject.</p>

<p>Whether a man has a real relationship to his own past or
not, involves the question as to whether he has a desire for
immortality, or if the idea of death is indifferent to him.</p>

<p>The desire for immortality is to-day, as a rule, treated
shamefully, and in a very different spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span></p>

<p>Not only is the problem treated as merely ontological, but
the psychological side of it is only trifled with. It has been
held that it is connected, like the doctrine of the transmigration
of souls, with the feeling that we have all experienced,
when, in doing something certainly for the first time,
we seem to remember having gone through the same
experience before. Another generally adopted view is to
derive the idea of immortality from the belief in spirits, as
has been done by Tylor, Spencer, Avenarius, and others,
although in any other age than this age of experimental
psychology it would have been dismissed <i>a priori</i>. I am
sure that it must seem impossible to the majority of
thinking men to regard a belief so important to mankind,
about which there has been so much strife, as merely
the last stage in a syllogism of which the first premiss
is the midnight dream of a dead man. How can phenomena
of that kind explain the belief in the continuity of
their lives after death held so firmly by Goethe or Bach, or
the desire for immortality which speaks to us in Beethoven&#8217;s
last sonatas? The desire for the persistence of the conscious
self must spring from sources mightier than these
feeble rationalistic guesses.</p>

<p>The deeper source of the belief depends on the relation of
a man to his own past. Our consciousness and vision of the
past is the strongest ground for our desire to be conscious
in the future. The man who values his past, who holds his
mental life in greater respect than his corporeal life, is not
willing to give up his consciousness at death. And so this
organic primary desire for immortality is strongest in men
of genius, in the men whose pasts are richest. This connection
between the desire for immortality and memory
receives strong support from what is related by those who
have been rescued from sudden death. Even if they had
not thought it out before they relive their past in a few
moments, at once and with frantic rapidity. The feeling of
what is impending brings in violent contrast the intensity of
the present consciousness and the idea that it may cease for
ever. In reality we know very little of the mental state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
the dying. It takes more than an ordinary person to interpret
it, and for reasons connected with what I have been
saying men of genius usually avoid death-beds. But it is
quite wrong to ascribe the sudden appearance of religion in
so many people who are fatally ill, to a desire to make sure
of their future state. It is extremely superficial to assume
that the doctrine of hell can for the first time assume such
an importance to the dying as to make them afraid to pass
away &#8220;with a lie on their lips.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote10"><a href="#FNanchor10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> I venture to remind readers how often at the approach of
death those who have been occupied with purely scientific matters
have turned to religious problems, <i>e.g.</i>, Newton, Gauss, Riemann,
Weber.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The important point is this: Why do men who have
lived throughout a lying life feel towards the end a
sudden desire for truth? And why are others so horrified,
although they do not believe in punishment in the next
world, when they hear of a man dying with a lie on his
lips or with an unrepented action? And why have both
the hardness of heart until the end and the death-bed
repentance appealed so forcibly to the imagination of
poets? The discussion as to the &#8220;euthanasia&#8221; of atheists,
which was so popular in the eighteenth century, is more
than a mere historical curiosity as F. A. Lange considered
it.</p>

<p>I adduce these considerations not merely to suggest a
possibility which is hardly more than a guess. It seems
to be unthinkable that it is not the case that many more
people than actual geniuses have some trace of genius.
The quantitative difference in natural endowment will
be most marked at the moment when the endowment
becomes active. And for most men this moment is the
point of death. If we were not accustomed to regard men
of genius as a separate class shut off from the others like the
payers of income-tax, we should find less difficulty in
grafting these new ideas on the old. And just as the earliest
recollections of childhood which a man has are not the
result of some external event breaking through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
continuity of the past course of his life, but are the result
of his internal development, there comes to every one a day
on which his consciousness is so intensified that remembrance
remains, and from that time onwards, according to
his endowment, more or fewer remembrances are formed
(a factor which by itself upsets the whole of modern
psychology), so in different men there are many different
stimulants of the consciousness of which the last is the
hour of death, and from the point of view of their degree
of genius men might almost be classified by the
number of things that excite their consciousness. I take
this opportunity of again urging the falseness of a doctrine
of modern psychology (which treats men simply as
better or worse pieces of registering apparatus and takes
no notice of the internal, ontogenetic development of the
mind); I mean the idea that in youth we retain the greatest
number of impressions. We must not confuse really experienced
impressions with the mere material on which to
exercise memorising. Such stuff a child learns more easily
simply because it is not weighted with mental impressions.
A psychology which is opposed to experience in
matters so fundamental must be rejected. What I am
attempting at present is no more than to give the faintest
indication of that ontogenetic psychology or theoretical
biography which sooner or later will replace what now
passes for the science of mind. Every programme represents
some definite conviction; before we wish to reach a
goal we have some definite conception of what the goal
is to be. The name &#8220;theoretical biography&#8221; will define
the new subject from philosophy and physiology, and the
biological method of treatment introduced by Darwin,
Spencer, and others will be widened until it becomes a
science capable of giving a rational orderly account of
the whole course of the mental life from the cradle to the
grave. It is to be called biography, not biology, because
it is to deal with the investigation of the permanent laws
that rule the mental development of an individual, whereas
biology itself concerns itself with individuals themselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
The new knowledge will seek general points of view and
the establishment of types. Psychology must try to become
theoretical biography. Existing psychology would
find its place in the branches of the new science, and in
this way only would Wundt&#8217;s desire to establish the foundations
of a science of the mind be fulfilled. It would be
absurd to despair of this simply because of the uselessness
of the existing science of the mind which has not yet even
grasped its own object. In this way a justification for
experimental psychology might yet be found, in spite of the
important results of the investigations by Windelband and
Rickert on the relation between natural and psychical
science, or the old dichotomy between the physical and
mental sciences.</p>

<p>The relation between the continuity of memory and the
desire for immortality is borne out by the fact that woman
is devoid of the desire for immortality. It is to be noted
that those persons are quite wrong who have attributed the
desire for immortality to the fear of death. Women are as
much afraid of death as are men, but they have not the
longing for immortality.</p>

<p>My attempted explanation of the psychological desire for
immortality is as yet more an indication of the connection
between the desire and memory than a deduction from a
higher natural law. It will always be found that the connection
actually exists; the more a man lives in his past
(not, as a superficial reader might guess, in his future) the
more intense will be his longing for immortality. The lack
of the desire for immortality in women is to be associated
with the lack in them of reverence for their own personality.
It seems, however, that the absence of both reverence and
desire for immortality in woman is due to a more general
principle, and in the same fashion in the case of man the
co-existence of a higher form of memory and the desire for
immortality may be traced to some deeper root. So far, I
have attempted only to show the coincidence of the two,
how the deep respect for their own past and the deep desire
for their own future are to be found in the same individuals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
It will now be my task to find the common origin of these
two factors of the mind.</p>

<p>Let us take as a starting-point what we were able to lay
down as to the universality of the memory of great men.
To such everything is equally real: what took place long ago
and the most recent experience. Thus it happens that a
single experience does not end with the moment of time in
which it happened, does not disappear as this moment of
time disappears, but through the memory is wrested from
the grasp of time. Memory makes experience timeless; the
essence of it is that it should transcend time. A man can
only remember the past because memory is free from the
control of time, because events which in nature are functions
of time, in the spirit have conquered time.</p>

<p>But here a difficulty crops up. How can memory be a
negation of time if, on the other hand, it is certain that if
we had no memory we should be unconscious of time? It
is certainly true that we shall always be conscious of the
passing of time by our memory of the past. If the two are
in so intimate a relation how can the one be the negation of
the other?</p>

<p>The difficulty is easy to resolve. It is just because a
living creature&mdash;not necessarily a human being&mdash;by being
endowed with memory is not wholly absorbed by the
experiences of the moment that it can, so to speak, oppose
itself to time, take cognisance of it, and make it the subject
of observation. Were the being wholly abandoned to the
experience of the moment and not saved from it by memory
then it would change with time and be a floating bubble in
the stream of events; it could never be conscious of time,
for consciousness implies duality. The mind must have
transcended time to grasp it, it must have stood outside it
in order to be able to reflect upon it. This does not apply
merely to special moments of time, as, for instance, to the
case that we cannot be conscious of sorrow until the sorrow
is over, but it is a part of the conception of time. If we
could not free ourselves from time, we could have no
knowledge of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>In order to understand the condition of timelessness let
us reflect on what memory rescues from time. What transcends
time is only what is of interest to the individual,
what has meaning for him; in fact, all that he assigns value
to. We remember only the things that have some value for
us even if we are unconscious of the value. It is the value
that creates the timelessness. We forget everything that has
no value for us even if we are unconscious of that absence
of value.</p>

<p>What has value, then, is timeless; or, to put it the other
way, a thing has the more value the less it is a function
of time. In all the world value is in proportion to independence
of time; only things that are timeless have a
positive value. Although this is not what I take to be the
deepest and fullest meaning of value, it is, at least, the first
special law of the theory of values.</p>

<p>A hasty survey of common facts will suffice to prove this
relation between value and duration. We are always inclined
to pay little attention to the views of those whom we
have known only for a short time, and, as a rule, we think
little of the hasty judgments of those who easily change their
ideas. On the other hand, uncompromising fixedness gains
respect, even if it assume the form of vindictiveness or
obstinacy. The <i>&aelig;re perennius</i> of the Roman poets and the
Egyptian pyramids lasting for forty centuries are favourite
images. The reputation a man leaves behind him would
soon be depreciated were it suspected that it would soon
disappear instead of being handed down the centuries. A
man dislikes to be told that he is always changing; but let it
be put that he is simply showing new sides of his character
and he will be proud of the permanence through the
changes. He who is tired of life, for whom life has ceased
to be of interest, is interesting to no one. The fear of the
extinction of a name or of a family is well known.</p>

<p>So also statute laws and customs lose in value if their
validity is expressly limited in time; and if two people are
making a bargain, they will be the more ready to distrust
one another if the bargain is to be only of short duration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
In fact, the value that we attach to things depends to a large
extent on our estimate of their durability.</p>

<p>This law of values is the chief reason why men are interested
in their death and their future. The desire for value
shows itself in the efforts to free things from time, and this
pressure is exerted even in the case of things which sooner
or later must change, as, for instance, riches and position
and everything that we call the goods of this world. Here
lies the psychological motive for the making of wills and the
bestowal of property. The motive is not care for relatives,
because a man without relatives very often is more anxious
to settle his goods, not feeling, perhaps, like the head of
a family, that in any event his existence will have some
kind of permanence, that traces of him will be left after his
own death.</p>

<p>The great politician or ruler, and especially the despot,
whose rule ends with his death, seeks to increase his own
value by making it independent of time. He may attempt
it through a code of laws or a biography like that of Julius
C&aelig;sar, by some great philosophical undertaking, by the
founding of museums or collections, or (and this perhaps is
the favourite way) by alterations of the calendar. And he
seeks to extend his power to the utmost during his life-time,
to preserve it and make it stable by enduring contracts and
diplomatic marriages, and most of all by attacking and removing
everything that could endanger the permanence of
his kingdom. And so the politician becomes a conqueror.</p>

<p>Psychological and philosophical investigations of the
theory of values have neglected the time element. Perhaps
this is because they have been very much under the influence
of political economy. I believe, however, that the application
of my principle to political economy would be of
considerable value. Very slight reflection will lead one to
see that in commercial affairs the time element is a most
important factor in estimating value. The common definition
of value, that it is in proportion to the power of the
thing valued to relieve our wants, is quite incomplete without
the element of time. Such things as air and water have<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
no value only in so far as they are not localised and
individualised; but as soon as they have been localised and
individualised, and so received form, they have received a
quality that may not last, and with the idea of duration
comes the idea of value. Form and timelessness, or individuation
and duration, are the two factors which compose
value.</p>

<p>Thus it can be shown that the fundamental law of the
theory of value applies both to individual psychology and to
social psychology. And now I can return to what is, after
all, the special task of this chapter.</p>

<p>The first general conclusion to be made is that the desire
for timelessness, a craving for value, pervades all spheres of
human activity. And this desire for real value, which is
deeply bound up with the desire for power, is completely
absent in the woman. It is only in comparatively rare cases
that old women trouble to make exact directions about the
disposition of their property, a fact in obvious relation with
the absence in them of the desire for immortality.</p>

<p>Over the dispositions of a man there is the weight of
something solemn and impressive&mdash;something which makes
him respected by other men.</p>

<p>The desire for immortality itself is merely a specific case
of the general law that only timeless things have a positive
value. On this is founded its connection with memory.
The permanence with which experiences stay with a man is
proportional to the significance which they had for him.
Putting it in a paradoxical form, I may say: Value is
created by the past. Only that which has a positive value
remains protected by memory from the jaws of time; and
so it may be with the individual psychical life as a whole.
If it is to have a positive value, it must not be a function
of time, but must subdue time by eternal duration after
physical death. This draws us incomparably nearer the
innermost motive of the desire for immortality. The complete
loss of significance which a rich, individual, fully-lived
life would suffer if it were all to end with death, and the
consequent senselessness of everything, as Goethe said, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
other words, to Eckermann (February 14, 1829) lead to
the demand for immortality. The strongest craving for
immortality is possessed by the genius, and this is explained
by all the other facts which have been discussed as to his
nature.</p>

<p>Memory only fully vanquishes time when it appears in a
universal form, as in universal men.</p>

<p>The genius is thus the only timeless man&mdash;at least, this
and nothing else is his ideal of himself; he is, as is proved
by his passionate and urgent desire for immortality, just the
man with the strongest demand for timelessness, with the
greatest desire for value.<a id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote11"><a href="#FNanchor11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
It is often a cause for astonishment that men with quite ordinary,
even vulgar, natures experience no fear of death. But it is
quite explicable: it is not the fear of death which creates the desire
for immortality, but the desire for immortality which causes fear of
death.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>And now we are face to face with an almost astonishing
coincidence. The timelessness of the genius will not only
be manifest in relation to the single moments of his life, but
also in his relation to what is known as &#8220;his generation,&#8221; or,
in a narrower sense, &#8220;his time.&#8221; As a matter of fact, he
has no relations at all with it. The age does not create the
genius it requires. The genius is not the product of his
age, is not to be explained by it, and we do him no honour
if we attempt to account for him by it.</p>

<p>Carlyle justly noted how many epochs had called for
great men, how badly they had needed them, and how they
still did not obtain them.</p>

<p>The coming of genius remains a mystery, and men
reverently abandon their efforts to explain it. And as the
causes of its appearance do not lie in any one age, so also
the consequences are not limited by time. The achievements
of genius live for ever, and time cannot change them.
By his works a man of genius is granted immortality on the
earth, and thus in a threefold manner he has transcended
time. His universal comprehension and memory forbid
the annihilation of his experiences with the passing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
moment in which each occurred; his birth is independent
of his age, and his work never dies.</p>

<p>Here is the best place to consider a question which,
strangely enough, appears to have received no attention.
The question is, if there be anything akin to genius in the
world of animals and plants? Although it must be
admitted that exceptional forms occur amongst animals
and plants, these cannot be regarded as coming under our
definition of genius. Talent may exist amongst them as
amongst men below the standard of genius. But the
special gift, what Moreau, Lombroso, and others have called
the &#8220;divine spark,&#8221; we must deny to animals. This limitation
is not jealousy nor the anxious guarding of a privilege,
but is founded on good grounds.</p>

<p>Is there anything unexplained by the assumption that the
first appearance of genius was in man! In the first place, it
is because of this that the human race has an objective
mind; in other words, that man is the only organism with a
history.</p>

<p>The history of the human race (naturally I mean the
history of its mind and not merely of its wars) is readily
intelligible on the theory of the appearance of genius, and
of the imitation by the more monkey-like individuals of the
conduct of those with genius. The chief stages, no doubt,
were house-building, agriculture, and, above all, speech.
Every single word has been the invention of a single man,
as, indeed, we still see, if we leave out of consideration the
merely technical terms. How else could language have
arisen? The earliest words were &#8220;onomatopoetic&#8221;; a
sound similar to the exciting cause was evolved almost
without the will of the speaker, in direct response to the
sensuous stimulation. All the other words were originally
metaphors, or comparisons, a kind of primitive poetry, for
all prose has come from poetry. Many, perhaps the
majority of the greatest geniuses, have remained unknown.
Think of the proverbs, now almost commonplaces, such as
&#8220;one good turn deserves another.&#8221; These were said for
the first time by some great man. How many quotations<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
from the classics, or sayings of Christ, have passed into the
common language, so that we have to think twice before we
can remember who were the authors of them. Language
is as little the work of the multitude as our ballads. Every
form of speech owes much that is not acknowledged to
individuals of another language. Because of the universality
of genius, the words and phrases that he invents are useful
not only to those who use the language in which he wrote
them. A nation orients itself by its own geniuses, and
derives from them its ideas of its own ideals, but the guiding
star serves also as a light to other nations. As speech has
been created by a few great men, the most extraordinary
wisdom lies concealed in it, a wisdom which reveals itself
to a few ardent explorers but which is usually overlooked
by the stupid professional philologists.</p>

<p>The genius is not a critic of language, but its creator, as
he is the creator of all the mental achievements which are
the material of culture and which make up the objective
mind, the spirit of the peoples. The &#8220;timeless&#8221; men are
those who make history, for history can be made only by
those who are not floating with the stream. It is only those
who are unconditioned by time who have real value, and
whose productions have an enduring force. And the
events that become forces of culture become so only because
they have an enduring value.</p>

<p>If we make a criterion of genius the exhibition of this
threefold &#8220;timelessness&#8221; we shall have a measure by which
it is easy to test all claimants. Lombroso and T&uuml;rck have
expanded the popular view which ascribes genius to all
whose intellectual or practical achievements are much
above the average. Kant and Schelling have insisted on
the more exclusive doctrine that genius can be predicated
only of the great creative artists. The truth probably lies
between the two. I am inclined to think that only great
artists and great philosophers (amongst the latter, I include,
above all, the great religious teachers) have proved a claim
to genius. Neither the &#8220;man of action&#8221; nor &#8220;the man of
science&#8221; has any claim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span></p>

<p>Men of action, famous politicians and generals, may
possess a few traits resembling genius (particularly a
specially good knowledge of men and an enormous capacity
for remembering people). The psychology of such traits
will be dealt with later; they are confused with genius only
by those whom the externals of greatness dazzle. The man
of genius almost typically renounces such external greatness
because of the real greatness within him. The really great
man has the strongest sense of values; the distinguished
general is absorbed by the desire for power. The former
seeks to link power with real value; the latter desires that
power itself should be valued. Great generals and great
politicians, like the bird Ph&#339;nix, are born out of fiery chaos
and like it disappear again in chaos. The great emperor
or the great demagogue is the only man who lives entirely
in the present; he does not dream of a more beautiful,
better future; his mind does not dwell on his own past
which has already passed, and so in the two ways most
possible to man, he does not transcend time, but lives only
in the moment. The great genius does not let his work be
determined by the concrete finite conditions that surround
him, whilst it is from these that the work of the statesman
takes its direction and its termination. And so the great
emperor is no more than a phenomenon of nature, whereas
the genius is outside nature and is an incorporation of the
mind. The works of men of action crumble at the death of
their authors, if indeed they have not already decayed, or
they survive only a brief time leaving no traces behind
them except what the chronicles record as having been
done and later undone. The emperor creates no works
that survive time, passing into eternity; such creations come
from genius. It is the genius in reality and not the other
who is the creator of history, for it is only the genius who
is outside and unconditioned by history. The great man
has a history, the emperor is only a part of history. The
great man transcends time; time creates and time destroys
the emperor.</p>

<p>The great man of science, unless he is also a philosopher<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
(I think of such names as Newton and Gauss, Linn&aelig;us
and Darwin, Copernicus and Galileo), deserves the title of
genius as little as the man of action. Men of science are
not universal; they deal only with a branch or branches of
knowledge. This is not due, as is sometimes said, merely to
the extreme modern specialisation that makes it impossible
to master everything. Even in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries there are still amongst the learned men individuals
with a knowledge as many-sided as that of Aristotle or
Leibnitz; the names of von Humboldt and William Wundt
at once come to my mind. The absence of genius comes
from something much more deeply seated in the men of
science, and in science itself, from a cause which I shall
explain in the eighth chapter. Probably some one may be
disposed to argue that if even the most distinguished men
of science have not a knowledge so universal as that of the
philosopher, there are some who stand on the outermost
fringes of philosophy, and to whom it is yet difficult to deny
the word genius. I think of such men as Fichte, Schleiermacher,
Carlyle, and Nietzsche. Which of the merely
scientific has felt in himself an unconditioned comprehension
of all men and of all things, or even the capacity to
verify any single thing in his mind and by his mind? On
the contrary, has not the whole history of the science of the
last thousand years been directed against this? This is the
reason why men of science are necessarily one-sided. No
man of science, unless he is also a philosopher, however
eminent his achievements, has that continuous unforgetting
life that the genius exhibits, and this is because of his want
of universality.</p>

<p>Finally, it is to be observed that the investigations of the
scientific are always in definite relation to the knowledge of
their day. The scientific man takes possession of a definite
store of experimental or observed knowledge, increases or
alters it more or less, and then hands it on. And much will
be taken away from his achievements, much will silently
disappear; his treatises may make a brave show in the
libraries, but they cease to be actively alive. On the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
hand, we can ascribe to the work of the great philosopher,
as to that of the great artist, an imperishable, unchangeable
presentation of the world, not disappearing with time, and
which, because it was the expression of a great mind, will
always find a school of men to adhere to it. There still exist
disciples of Plato and Aristotle, of Spinoza and Berkeley
and Bruno, but there are now none who denote themselves
as followers of Galileo or Helmholtz, of Ptolemy or
Copernicus. It is a misuse of terms, due to erroneous ideas,
to speak of the &#8220;classics&#8221; of science or of pedagogy in the
sense that we speak of the classics of philosophy and art.</p>

<p>The great philosopher bears the name of genius deservedly
and with honour. And if it will always be the greatest pain
to the philosopher that he is not an artist, so the artist envies
the philosopher his tenacious and controlled strength of
systematic thought, and it is not surprising that the artist has
taken pleasure in depicting Prometheus and Faust, Prospera
and Cyprian, Paul the Apostle and Il Penseroso. The philosopher
and the artist are alternate sides of one another.</p>

<p>We must not be too lavish in attributing genius to those
who are philosophers or we shall not escape the reproach of
being merely partisans of philosophy against science. Such
a partisanship is foreign to my purpose, and, I hope, to this
book. It would only be absurd to discuss the claims
to genius of such men as Anaxagoras, Geulincx, Baader, or
Emerson. I deny genius either to such unoriginally profound
writers as Angelus Silesius, Philo and Jacobi, or to
original yet superficial persons such as Comte, Feuerbach,
Hume, Herbart, Locke and Karneades. The history of art
is equally full of preposterous valuations, whilst, on the
other hand, the history of science is extremely free from
false estimations. The history of science busies itself very
little with the biographies of its protagonists; its object is
a system of objective, collective knowledge in which the
individual is swept away. The service of science demands
the greatest sacrifice, for in it the individual human being
renounces all claim to eternity as such.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
MEMORY, LOGIC, AND ETHICS</h3>

<p>The title that I have given to this chapter at once opens the
way to misinterpretation. It might appear as if the author
supported the view that logical and ethical values were the
objects exclusively of empirical psychology, psychical
phenomena, like perception and sensation, and that logic
and ethics, therefore, were subsections of psychology and
based upon psychology.</p>

<p>I declare at once that I call this view, the so-called psychologismus,
at once false and injurious. It is false because
it can lead to nothing; and injurious because, while it
hardly touches logic and ethics, it overthrows psychology
itself. The exclusion of logic and ethics from the foundations
of psychology, and the insertion of them in an
appendix, is one of the results of the overgrowth of the
doctrine of empirical perception, of that strange heap of
dead, fleshless bones which is known as empirical psychology,
and from which all real experience has been excluded.
I have nothing to do with the empirical school, and in this
matter lean towards the transcendentalism of Kant.</p>

<p>As the object of my work, however, is to discover the
differences between different members of humanity, and not
to discuss categories that would hold good for the angels in
heaven, I shall not follow Kant closely, but remain more
directly in psychological paths.</p>

<p>The justification of the title of this chapter must be
reached along other lines. The tedious, because entirely
new, demonstration of the earlier part of my work has
shown that the human memory stands in intimate relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
with things hitherto supposed unconnected with it&mdash;such
things as time, value, genius, immortality. I have attempted
to show that memory stands in intimate connection with all
these. There must be some strong reason for the complete
absence of earlier allusions to this side of the subject. I
believe the reason to be no more than the inadequacy
and slovenliness which hitherto have spoiled theories of
memory.</p>

<p>I must here call attention to a theory first propounded by
Charles Bonnet in the middle of the eighteenth century and
towards the end of the nineteenth century, specially insisted
upon by Ewald Hering and E. Mach. This theory regarded
the human memory as being only a special case of a property
common to all organised matter, the property that
makes the path of new stimuli rather easier if these resemble
stimuli that have acted at some former time. The theory
really makes the human memory an adaptation in the
sense of Lamarck, the result on the living organism of
repeated stimulation. It is true that there is a point in
common between the human memory and the increase of
sensitiveness caused by the repeated application of a stimulus;
that identical element consists in the permanence of
the effect of the first stimulation. There is, however, a
fundamental difference between the growth of a muscle
that is much used or the adaptation of the eater of arsenic
or morphia to increased doses, and the recollection of past
experiences by human beings. In the one case the trace of
the old is just to be felt in the new stimulation; in the other
case, by means of the consciousness, the old situations are
actually reproduced with all their individuation. The identification
of the two is so superficial that it is a waste of
time to dwell longer on it.</p>

<p>The doctrine of association as the theory of memory is
linked with the foregoing physiological theory as a matter
of history, through Hartley, and, as a matter of fact,
because the idea of habit is shared by the two. The association
theory attributes memory to the mechanical play
of the linking of presentations according to four laws. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
overlooks the fact that memory (the continuous memory of
man) is a function of the will. I can remember a thing if
I really <i>will</i>. In the case of hypnosis, when the recollection
of all that has been forgotten is induced, an outside
will replaces the will of the subject. It is will that sets in
action the chains of association, and we have to deal here
with something deeper than a mechanical principle.</p>

<p>In the association psychology, which first splits up the
psychic life, and then vainly imagines that it can weld the
re-assorted pieces together again, there is another confusion,
the confusion between memory and recollection, which
has persisted in spite of the well-founded objections of
Avenarius and von H&ouml;ffding. The recognition of a circumstance
does not necessarily involve the special reproduction
of the former impression, even although there seems to be a
tendency for the new impression, at least, partly to recall the
old one. But there is another kind of recognition, perhaps
as common, in which the new impression does not appear
to be directly linked with an association, but in which it
comes, so to speak, &#8220;coloured&#8221; (James would say &#8220;tinged&#8221;)
with that character that would be called by von H&ouml;ffding
the &#8220;familiarity quality.&#8221; To him who returns to his native
place the roads and streets seem familiar, even although he
has forgotten the names, has to ask his way, and can think
of no special occasion on which he went along them. A
melody may seem &#8220;familiar&#8221; and yet I may be unable to
say where I heard it. The &#8220;character&#8221; (in the sense of
Avenarius) of familiarity, of intimacy, hovers over the sense-impression
itself, and analysis can detect no associations,
none of the fusing of the old and new, which, according to
the assertion of a presumptuous pseudo-psychology, produces
the feeling; these cases are quite easy to distinguish from
cases in which there is a real although vague association
with an older experience in henid form.</p>

<p>In individual psychology this distinction is of great
importance. In the highest types of mankind the consciousness
of the continuous past is present in so active a form
that the moment such a one sees an acquaintance in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
street he is at once able to reproduce the last meeting as a
complete experience, whereas in the case of the less gifted
person, the feeling of familiarity that makes recognition
possible, occurs when he is able to recall the past connection
in all its details.</p>

<p>If we now, in conclusion, ask whether or no other animals
than man possess a similar faculty for remembering and
reviving their earlier lives in their entirety it is most probable
that the answer must be in the negative. Animals could
not, as they do, remain for hours at a time, motionless and
peaceful on one spot, if they were capable of thinking of the
future or of remembering the past. Animals have the feeling
of familiarity and the sense of expectation (as we find from
the recognition of his master by a dog after twenty years&#8217;
absence); but they possess no memory and no hope. They
are capable of recognition through the sense of familiarity,
but they have no memory.</p>

<p>As memory has been shown to be a special character
unconnected with the lower spheres of psychical life, and
the exclusive property of human beings, it is not surprising
that it is closely related to such higher things as the idea of
value and of time, and the craving for immortality, which
is absent in animals, and possible to men only in so far as
they possess the quality of genius. If memory be an essentially
human thing, part of the deepest being of humanity,
finding expression in mankind&#8217;s most peculiar qualities,
then it will not be surprising if memory be also related to
the phenomena of logic and ethics. I have now to explore
this relationship.</p>

<p>I may set out from the old proverb that liars have bad
memories. It is certain that the pathological liar has practically
no memory. About male liars I shall have more to
say; they are not common, however. But if we remember
what was said as to the absence of memory amongst women
we shall not be surprised at the existence of the numerous
proverbs and common sayings about the untruthfulness of
women. It is evident that a being whose memory is very
slight, and who can recall only in the most imperfect fashion<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
what it has said or done, or suffered, must lie easily if it has
the gift of speech. The impulse to untruthfulness will be
hard to resist if there is a practical object to be gained, and
if the influence that comes from a full conscious reality of
the past be not present. The impulse to lie is stronger in
woman, because, unlike that of man, her memory is not
continuous, whilst her life is discrete, unconnected, discontinuous,
swayed by the sensations and perceptions of
the moment instead of dominating them. Unlike man, her
experiences float past without being referred, so to speak,
to a definite, permanent centre; she does not feel herself,
past and present, to be one and the same throughout all her
life. It happens almost to every man that sometimes he
&#8220;does not understand himself&#8221;; indeed, with very many
men, it happens (leaving out of the question the facts of
psychical periodicity) that if they think over their pasts in
their minds they find it very difficult to refer all the events
to a single conscious personality; they do not grasp how
it could have been that they, being what they feel themselves
at the time to be, could ever have done or felt or thought
this, that, or the other. And yet in spite of the difficulty,
they know that they had gone through these experiences.
The feeling of identity in all circumstances of life is quite
wanting in the true woman, because her memory, even if
exceptionally good, is devoid of continuity. The consciousness
of identity of the male, even although he may fail to
understand his own past, manifests itself in the very desire
to understand that past. Women, if they look back on
their earlier lives, never understand themselves, and do not
even wish to understand themselves, and this reveals itself
in the scanty interest they give to the attempts of man to
understand them. The woman does not interest herself about
herself, and hence there have been no female psychologists,
no psychology of women written by a woman, and she is
incapable of grasping the anxious desire of the man to
understand the beginning, middle, and end of his individual
life in their relation to each other, and to interpret the
whole as a continual, logical, necessary sequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span></p>

<p>At this point there is a natural transition to logic. A
creature like woman, the absolute woman, who is not conscious
of her own identity at different stages of her life, has
no evidence of the identity of the subject-matter of thought
at different times. If in her mind the two stages of a change
cannot be present simultaneously by means of memory, it
is impossible for her to make the comparison and note the
change. A being whose memory is never sufficiently good
as to make it psychologically possible to perceive identity
through the lapse of time, so as to enable her, for instance,
to pursue a quantity through a long mathematical reckoning;
such a creature in the extreme case would be unable to
control her memory for even the moment of time required
to say that A will be still A in the next moment, to pronounce
judgment on the identity A = A, or on the opposite proposition
that A is not equal to A, for that proposition also
requires a continuous memory of A to make the comparison
possible.</p>

<p>I have been making no mere joke, no facetious sophism
or paradoxical proposition. I assert that the judgment of
identity depends on conceptions, never on mere perceptions
and complexes of perceptions, and the conceptions, as
logical conceptions, are independent of time, retaining their
constancy, whether I, as a psychological entity, think them
constant or not. But man never has a conception in the
purely logical form, for he is a psychological being, affected
by the condition of sensations; he is able only to form a
general idea (a typical, connotative, representative conception)
out of his individual experiences by a reciprocal
effacing of the differences and strengthening of the similarities,
thus, however, very closely approximating to an
abstract conception, and in a most wonderful fashion using
it as such. He must also be able to preserve this idea
which he thinks clear, although in reality it is confused, and
it is memory alone that brings about the possibility of that.
Were he deprived of memory he would lose the possibility
of thinking logically, for this possibility is incarnated, so to
speak, only in a psychological medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span></p>

<p>Memory, then, is a necessary part of the logical faculty.
The propositions of logic are not conditioned by the existence
of memory, but only the power to use them. The
proposition A = A must have a psychological relation to
time, otherwise it would be At<sub>1</sub> = At<sub>2</sub>. Of course this is not
the case in pure logic, but man has no special faculty of
pure logic, and must act as a psychological being.</p>

<p>I have already shown that the continuous memory is the
vanquisher of time, and, indeed, is necessary even for the
idea of time to be formed. And so the continuous memory
is the psychological expression of the logical proposition of
identity. The absolute woman, in whom memory is absent,
cannot take the proposition of identity, or its contradictory,
or the exclusion of the alternative, as axiomatic.</p>

<p>Besides these three conditions of logical thought, the
fourth condition, the containing of the conclusion in the
major premiss, is possible only through memory. That
proposition is the groundwork of the syllogism. The premisses
psychologically precede the conclusion, and must be
retained by the thinking person whilst the minor premiss
applies the law of identity or of non-identity. The grounds
for the conclusion must lie in the past. And for this reason
continuity which dominates the mental processes of man is
bound up with causality. Every psychological application
of the relation of a conclusion to its premisses implies the
continuity of memory to guarantee the identity of the propositions.
As woman has no continuous memory she can
have no <i>principium rationis sufficientis</i>.</p>

<p>And so it appears that woman is without logic.</p>

<p>George Simmel has held this familiar statement to be
erroneous, inasmuch as women have been known to draw
conclusions with the strongest consistency. That a woman
in a concrete case can unrelentingly pursue a given course
at the stimulation of some object is no more a proof that
she understands the syllogism, than is her habit of perpetually
recurring to disproved arguments a proof that the law of
identity is an axiom for her. The point at issue is whether
or no they recognise the logical axioms as the criteria of<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
the validity of their thoughts, as the directors of their process
of thinking, whether they make or do not make these the
rule of conduct and the principle of judgment. A woman
cannot grasp that one must act from principle; as she has
no continuity she does not experience the necessity for
logical support of her mental processes. Hence the ease
with which women assume opinions. If a woman gives vent
to an opinion, or statement, and a man is so foolish as
to take it seriously and to ask her for the proof of it,
she regards the request as unkind and offensive, and as
impugning her character. A man feels ashamed of himself,
feels himself guilty if he has neglected to verify a thought,
whether or no that thought has been uttered by him; he
feels the obligation to keep to the logical standard which he
has set up for himself. Woman resents any attempt to
require from her that her thoughts should be logical. She
may be regarded as &#8220;logically insane.&#8221;</p>

<p>The most common defect which one could discover in the
conversation of a woman, if one really wished to apply to it
the standard of logic (a feat that man habitually shuns, so
showing his contempt for a woman&#8217;s logic) is the <i>quaternio
terminorum</i>, that form of equivocation which is the result of
an incapacity to retain definite presentations; in other words
the result of a failure to grasp the law of identity. Woman is
unaware of this; she does not realise the law nor make it a
criterion of thought. Man feels himself bound to logic; the
woman is without this feeling. It is only this feeling of guilt
that guarantees man&#8217;s efforts to think logically. Probably
the most profound saying of Descartes, and yet one that
has been widely misunderstood, is that all errors are crimes.</p>

<p>The source of all error in life is failure of memory. Thus
logic and ethics, both of which deal with the furtherance of
truth and join in its highest service, are dependent on
memory. The conception dawns on us that Plato was not
so far wrong when he connected discernment with memory.
Memory, it is true, is not a logical and ethical act, but it is a
logical and ethical phenomenon. A man who has had a
vivid and deep perception regards it as a fault, if some half-hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
afterwards he is thinking of something different, even
if external influences have intervened. A man thinks himself
unconscientious and blameworthy if he notices that he
has not thought of a particular portion of his life for a long
time. Memory, moreover, is linked with morality, because
it is only through memory that repentance is possible. All
forgetfulness is in itself immoral. And so reverence is a
moral exercise; it is a duty to forget nothing, and for this
reason we should reverence the dead. Equally from logical
and ethical motives, man tries to carry logic into his past, in
order that past and present may become one.</p>

<p>It is with something of a shock that we realise here that
we approach the deep connection between logic and ethics,
long ago suggested by Socrates and Plato, discovered anew
by Kant and Fichte, but lost sight of by living workers.</p>

<p>A creature that cannot grasp the mutual exclusiveness of
A and not A has no difficulty in lying; more than that,
such a creature has not even any consciousness of lying,
being without a standard of truth. Such a creature if
endowed with speech will lie without knowing it, without
the possibility of knowing it; <i>Veritas norma sui et falsa est</i>.
There is nothing more upsetting to a man than to find, when
he has discovered a woman in a lie, and has asked her,
&#8220;Why did you lie about it?&#8221; that she simply does not
understand the question, but simply looks at him and
laughingly tries to soothe him, or bursts into tears.</p>

<p>The subject does not end with the part played by memory.
Lying is common enough amongst men. And lies can be
told in spite of a full remembrance of the subject which for
some purpose some one wishes to be informed about.
Indeed, it might almost be said that the only persons who
can lie are those who misrepresent facts in spite of a
superior knowledge and consciousness of them.</p>

<p>Truth must first be regarded as the real value of logic and
ethics before it is correct to speak of deviations from truth
for special motives as lies from the moral point of view.
Those who have not this high conception should be
adjudged as guilty rather of vagueness and exaggeration<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
than of lying; they are not immoral but non-moral. And
in this sense the woman is non-moral.</p>

<p>The root of such an absolute misconception of truth must
lie deep. The continuous memory against which alone a
man can be false, is not the real source of the effort for
truth, the desire for truth, the basal ethical-logical
phenomenon, but only stands in intimate relation with it.</p>

<p>That which enables man to have a real relation to truth
and which removes his temptation to lie, must be something
independent of all time, something absolutely
unchangeable, which as faithfully reproduces the old as if it
were new, because it is permanent itself; it can only be
that source in which all discrete experiences unite and
which creates from the first a continuous existence. It is
what produces the feeling of responsibility which oppresses
all men, young and old, as to their actions, which makes
them know that they are responsible, which leads to the
phenomena of repentance and consciousness of sin, which
calls to account before an eternal and ever present self
things that are long past, its judgment being subtler and
more comprehensive than that of any court of law or of the
laws of society, and which is exerted by the individual himself
quite independently of all social codes (so condemning
the moral psychology which would derive morality from
the social life of man). Society recognises the idea of
illegality, but not of sin; it presses for punishment without
wishing to produce repentance; lying is punished by the
law only in its ceremonious form of perjury, and error has
never been placed under its ban. Social ethics with its
conception of duty to our neighbour and to society, and
practical exclusion from consideration of the other fifteen
hundred million human beings, cannot extend the realm
of morality, when it begins by limiting it in this arbitrary
fashion.</p>

<p>What is this &#8220;centre of apperception&#8221; that is superior to
time and change?</p>

<p>It can be nothing less than what raises man above himself
(as a part of the world of sense) which joins him to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
order of things that only the reason can grasp, and that
puts the whole world of sense at his feet. It is nothing else
than personality.</p>

<p>The most sublime book in the world, the &#8220;Criticism of
Practical Reason,&#8221; has referred morality to an intelligent
ego, distinct from all empirical consciousness. I must now
turn to that side of my subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span></p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
LOGIC, ETHICS AND THE EGO</h3>

<p>David Hume is well known to have abolished the conception
of the ego by seeing in it only a bundle of different
perceptions in continual ebb and flow. However completely
Hume thought himself to have compromised the ego, at
least he explained his view relatively moderately. He
proposed to say nothing about a few metaphysicians who
appeared to rejoice in another kind of ego; for himself he
was quite certain that he had none, and he dared to suppose
that the majority of mankind, leaving the few peculiar
metaphysicians out of the question, were, like himself, mere
bundles. So the polite man expressed himself. In the
next chapter I shall show how his irony recoils on himself.
That his view became so famous depends partly on the
over-estimation in which Hume is held and which is largely
due to Kant. Hume was a most distinguished empirical
psychologist, but he cannot be regarded as a genius, the
popular view notwithstanding. It is not very much to be
the first of English philosophers, but Hume has not even a
claim to that position. I do not think that Kant would
have given so much praise to Hume if he had been fully
acquainted with all Hume&#8217;s work and not merely with the
&#8220;Enquiry,&#8221; as he certainly rejected the position of Spinoza,
according to which men were not &#8220;substances,&#8221; but merely
accidents.</p>

<p>Lichtenberg, who took the field against the ego later than
Hume, was still bolder. He is the philosopher of impersonality,
and calmly corrects the conversational &#8220;I think&#8221; into
an actual &#8220;it thinks&#8221;; he regards the ego as a creation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
the grammarian. In this Hume had anticipated him, inasmuch
as he also had declared, at the end of his analysis, all
disputes as to the identity of the person to be merely a
battle of words.</p>

<p>E. Mach has recently represented the universe as a
coherent mass, and the egos as points in which the coherent
mass has greater consistency. The only realities are the
perceptions, which are connected in one individual strongly,
but which are weaker in another individual who is thus
differentiated from the first.</p>

<p>The contents of the perceptions are the realities, and they
persist externally to the worthless personal recollections.
The ego is not a real but only a practical entity and cannot
be isolated, and, therefore, the idea of individual immortality
must be rejected. None the less the idea of an ego is not
wholly to be rejected; here and there, as, for instance, in
Darwin&#8217;s struggle for existence, it appears to have some
validity.</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how an investigator who has accomplished
so much, not only as a historian of his special branch
and as a critic of ideas, but who is also fully equipped
with knowledge of biology, should have paid no heed to the
fact that every organic being is indivisible from the first,
and is not composed of anything like atoms, monads, &amp;c.
The first distinctive mark of the living as opposed to
inorganic matter is that the former is always differentiated
into dissimilar, mutually dependent parts, and is not
homogeneous like a crystal. And so it should have been
borne in mind that it was at least possible that individuation,
the fact that organic beings are not united, like Siamese
twins, would prove to have importance in psychical matters,
and the ego, therefore, was more than Mach&#8217;s idea of it as
a mere waiting-hall of perceptions.</p>

<p>It may be that there exists a psychical correlation even
amongst animals. Everything that an animal feels and
perceives has a different &#8220;note&#8221; or &#8220;colour&#8221; in every
individual. This individual quality is not only characteristic
of the class, genus, species, race, and family, but also is<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
different in every individual of the same family, &amp;c. The
idioplasm is the physiological equivalent of this specific
individual quality of the sensations and perceptions, and
there are reasons analogous with those in favour of the
supposition of an idioplasm for the supposition of an
individual character amongst animals. The sportsman
who has to do with dogs, the trainer with horses, and the
keeper with animals will readily admit the existence of this
individuality as a constant element. It is clear that we have
to do here with something more than a mere rendezvous of
perceptions.</p>

<p>But even if this psychical analogue of the idioplasm were
proved to exist in the case of animals, it could not be
ranked with the intelligible character, the existence of which
in any living creature except man cannot be maintained.
The intelligible character of men, their individuation, has
the same relation to empirical character that memory has
to the simple power of recognition. And finally we come
to identity, by which the structure, form, law, and cosmos
persist even through the change of contents. The considerations
from which is drawn the proof of the existence in
man of such a noumenal, trans-empirical subject must now
be stated briefly. They come from logic and ethics.</p>

<p>Logic deals with the true significance of the principle of
identity (also with that of contradiction; the exact relation
of these two, and the various modes of stating it are controversial
matters outside the present subject). The proposition
A = A is axiomatic and self-evident. It is the primitive
measure of truth for all other propositions; however
much we may think over it we must return to this fundamental
proposition. It is the principle of the distinction
between truth and error; and he who regards it as meaningless
tautology, as was the case with Hegel and many of the
later empiricists (this being not the only surprising point of
contact between two schools apparently so different) is
right in a fashion, but has misunderstood the nature of the
proposition. A = A, the principle of all truth, cannot itself
be a special truth. He who finds the proposition of identity<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
or that of non-identity meaningless does so by his own
fault. He must have expected to find in these propositions
special ideas, a source of positive knowledge. But they
are not in themselves knowledge, separate acts of thought,
but the common standard for all acts of thought. And so
they cannot be compared with other acts of thought. The
rule of the process of thought must be outside thought.
The proposition of identity does not add to our knowledge;
it does not increase but rather founds a kingdom. The
proposition of identity is either meaningless or means
everything. Upon what do the propositions of identity
and of non-identity depend? The common view is that
they are judgments. Sigwart, for instance, who has recently
discussed the matter, puts it as follows: The two judgments
A is B and A is not B cannot be true at the same time
because the judgment &#8220;An unlearned man is learned&#8221;
would involve a contradiction because the predicate
&#8220;learned&#8221; is affirmed of a subject of which the judgment
has been made implicitly that he is unlearned, so
that in reality two judgments are made, X is learned and
X is unlearned. The &#8220;psychologismus&#8221; of this method of
argument is plain. It has recourse to a temporary judgment
preceding the formation of the conception &#8220;unlearned
man.&#8221; The proposition, however, A is not A claims validity
quite apart from the past, present, or future existence of
other judgments. It depends on the conception &#8220;unlearned
man.&#8221; It makes the conception more certain by excluding
contradictory instances.</p>

<p>This, then, gives us the true function of the principles of
identity and non-identity. They are materials for conceptions.</p>

<p>This function concerns only logical conceptions, but not
what have been called psychological conceptions. The
conception is always represented psychologically by a
generalisation; and this presentation in a certain fashion is
included in the conception. The generalisation represents
the conception psychologically, but is not identical with it.
It can, so to speak, be richer (as when I think of a triangle)<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
or it can be poorer (the conception of a lion contains more
than my generalisation of lions). The logical conception
is the plumb-line which the attention tries to follow; it is
the goal and pole-star of the psychological generalisation.</p>

<p>Pure logical thought cannot occur in the case of men;
it would be an attribute of deity. A human being must
always think partly psychologically because he possesses
not only reason but also senses, and his thought cannot free
itself from temporal experiences but must remain bound by
them. Logic, however, is the supreme standard by which
the individual can test his own psychological ideas and
those of others. When two men are discussing anything
it is the conception and not the varying individual presentations
of it that they aim at. The conception, then, is
the standard of value for the individual presentations. The
mode in which the psychological generalisation comes into
existence is quite independent of the conception and has
no significance in respect to it. The logical character
which invests the conception with dignity and power is
not derived from experience, for experience can give only
vague and wavering generalisations. Absolute constancy
and absolute coherence which cannot come from experience
are the essence of the conception of that power
concealed in the depths of the human mind whose handiwork
we try hard but in vain to see in nature. Conceptions
are the only true realities, and the conception is not
in nature; it is the rule of the essence not of the actual
existence.</p>

<p>When I enunciate the proposition A = A, the meaning
of the proposition is not that a special individual A of
experience or of thought is like itself. The judgment of
identity does not depend on the existence of an A. It
means only that if an A exists, or even if it does not exist,
then A = A. Something is posited, the existence of A = A
whether or no A itself exists. It cannot be the result of
experience, as Mill supposed, for it is independent of the
existence of A. But an existence has been posited; it is
not the existence of the object; it must be the existence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
the subject. The reality of the existence is not in the first
A or the second A, but in the simultaneous identity of the
two. And so the proposition A = A is no other than the
proposition &#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the psychological point of view, the real meaning
of the proposition of identity is not so difficult to interpret.
It is clear that to be able to say A = A, to establish the permanence
of the conception through the changes of experience,
there must be something unchangeable, and this
can be only the subject. Were I part of the stream of
change I could not verify that the A had remained
unchanged, had remained itself. Were I part of the
change, I could not recognise the change. Fichte was
right when he stated that the existence of the ego was to
be found concealed in pure logic, inasmuch as the ego is
the condition of intelligible existence.</p>

<p>The logical axioms are the principle of all truth. These
posit an existence towards which all cognition serves.
Logic is a law which must be obeyed, and man realises
himself only in so far as he is logical. He finds himself
in cognition.</p>

<p>All error must be felt to be crime. And so man must
not err. He <i>must</i> find the truth, and so he can find it.
The duty of cognition involves the possibility of cognition,
the freedom of thought, and the hope of ascertaining
truth. In the fact that logic is the condition of the mind
lies the proof that thought is free and can reach its goal.</p>

<p>I can treat ethics briefly and in another fashion, inasmuch
as what I have to say is founded on Kant&#8217;s moral
philosophy. The deepest, the intelligible, part of the nature
of man is that part which does not take refuge in
causality, but which chooses in freedom the good or the
bad. This is manifest in consciousness of sin and in
repentance. No one has attempted to explain these facts
otherwise; and no one allows himself to be persuaded
that he must commit this or that act. In the shall there
lies the possibility of the can. The causal determining
factors, the lower motives that act upon him, he is fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
aware of, but he remains conscious of an intelligible ego
free to act in a different way from other egos.</p>

<p>Truth, purity, faithfulness, uprightness, with reference to
oneself; these give the only conceivable ethics. Duty is
only duty to oneself, duty of the empirical ego to the
intelligible ego. These appear in the form of two imperatives
that will always put to shame every kind of psychologismus&mdash;the
logical law and the moral law. The internal
direction, the categorical imperatives of logic and morality
which dominate all the codes of social utilitarianism are
factors that no empiricism can explain. All empiricism
and scepticism, positivism and relativism, instinctively feel
that their principal difficulties lie in logic and ethics. And
so perpetually renewed and fruitless efforts are made to
explain this inward discipline empirically and psychologically.</p>

<p>Logic and ethics are fundamentally the same, they are
no more than duty to oneself. They celebrate their union
by the highest service of truth, which is overshadowed in
the one case by error, in the other by untruth. All ethics
are possible only by the laws of logic, and logic is no more
than the ethical side of law. Not only virtue, but also
insight, not only sanctity but also wisdom, are the duties
and tasks of mankind. Through the union of these alone
comes perfection.</p>

<p>Ethics, however, the laws of which are postulates, cannot
be made the basis of a logical proof of existence. Ethics are
not logical in the same sense that logic is ethical. Logic
proves the absolute actual existence of the ego; ethics control
the form which the actuality assumes. Ethics dominate
logic and make logic part of their contents.</p>

<p>In thinking of the famous passage in the &#8220;Critique of
Practical Reason,&#8221; where Kant introduces man as a part of
the intelligible cosmos, it may be asked how Kant assured
himself that the moral law was inherent in personality.
The answer Kant gave was simply that no other and no
nobler origin could be found for it. He goes no further
than to say that the categorical imperative is the law of<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
the noumenon, belonging to it and inherent in it from the
beginning. That, however, is the nature of ethics. Ethics
make it possible for the intelligible ego to act free from
the shackles of empiricism, and so through ethics, the
existence of whose possibilities logic assures us, is able to
become actual in all its purity.</p>

<p>There remains a most important point in which the
Kantian system is often misunderstood. It reveals itself
plainly in every case of wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Duty is only towards oneself; Kant must have realised
this in his earlier days when first he felt an impulse to lie.
Except for a few indications in Nietzsche, and in Stirner,
and a few others, Ibsen alone seems to have grasped the
principle of the Kantian ethics (notably in &#8220;Brand&#8221; and
&#8220;Peer Gynt&#8221;). The following two quotations also give
the Kantian view in a general way:</p>

<p>First Hebbel&#8217;s epigram, &#8220;Lies and Truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which do you pay dearer for, lies or the truth? The
former costs you yourself, the latter at most your happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is certainly true that most men need some kind of a
God. A few, and they are the men of genius, do not bow
to an alien law. The rest try to justify their doings and
misdoings, their thinking and existence (at least the mental
side of it), to some one else, whether it be the personal God
of the Jews, or a beloved, respected, and revered human
being. It is only in this way that they can bring their lives
under the social law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span></p>

<p>Kant was permeated with his conviction, as is conspicuous
in the minutest details of his chosen life-work,
that man was responsible only to himself, to such an
extent that he regarded this side of his theory as self-evident
and least likely to be disputed. This silence of Kant
has brought about a misunderstanding of his ethics&mdash;the
only ethics tenable from the psychologically introspective
standpoint, the only system according to which the insistent
strong inner voice of the one is to be heard through the
noise of the many.</p>

<p>I gather from a passage in his &#8220;Anthropology&#8221; that even
in the case of Kant some incident in his actual earthly life
preceded the &#8220;formation of his character.&#8221; The birth of
the Kantian ethics, the noblest event in the history of the
world, was the moment when for the first time the dazzling
awful conception came to him, &#8220;I am responsible only to
myself; I must follow none other; I must not forget
myself even in my work; I am alone; I am free; I am lord
of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two things fill my mind with ever renewed wonder
and awe the more often and the deeper I dwell on them&mdash;the
starry vault above me and the moral law within me. I
must not look on them both as veiled in mystery or think
that their majesty places them beyond me. I see them
before me, and they are part of the consciousness of my
existence. The first arises from my position in the outer
world of the senses, and links me with the immeasurable
space in which worlds and worlds and systems and systems,
although in immeasurable time, have their ebbs and flows,
their beginnings and ends. The second arises from my
invisible self, my personality, and places me in a world that
has true infinity, but which is evident only to the reason
and with which I recognise myself as being bound, not
accidentally as in the other case but in a universal and
necessary union. On the one hand, the consciousness of
an endless series of worlds destroys my sense of importance,
making me only one of the animal creatures which must
return its substance again to the planet (that, too, being no<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
more than a point in space) from whence it came, after
having been in some unknown way endowed with life for a
brief space. The second point of view enhances my importance,
makes me an intelligence, infinite and unconditioned
through my personality, the moral law in which
separates me from the animals and from the world of sense,
removes me from the limits of time and space, and links
me with infinity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secret of the critique of practical reason is that man
is alone in the world, in tremendous eternal isolation.</p>

<p>He has no object outside himself; lives for nothing else;
he is far removed from being the slave of his wishes, of his
abilities, of his necessities; he stands far above social
ethics; he is alone.</p>

<p>Thus he becomes one and all; he has the law in him,
and so he himself is the law, and no mere changing caprice.
The desire is in him to be only the law, to be the law that
is himself, without afterthought or forethought. This is
the awful conclusion, he has no longer the sense that there
can be duty for him. Nothing is superior to him, to the
isolated absolute unity. But there are no alternatives for
him; he must respond to his own categorical imperatives,
absolutely, impartially. &#8220;Freedom,&#8221; he cries (for instance,
Wagner, or Schopenhauer), &#8220;rest, peace from the enemy;
peace, not this endless striving&#8221;; and he is terrified. Even
in this wish for freedom there is cowardice; in the ignominious
lament there is desertion as if he were too small
for the fight. What is the use of it all, he cries to the
universe; and is at once ashamed, for he is demanding
happiness, and that his own burden should rest on other
shoulders. Kant&#8217;s lonely man does not dance or laugh;
he neither brawls nor makes merry; he feels no need to
make a noise, because the universe is so silent around him.
To acquiesce in his loneliness is the splendid supremacy of
the Kantian.</p>

<p>Many disputations about principles in psychology arise
from individual characterological differences in the disputants.
Thus, in the mode that I have already suggested,
characterology might play an important part. When one
person thinks to have discovered this, the other that, by
introspection, characterology would have to show why the
results in the one case should differ from those in the other,
or, at least, to point out in what other respects the persons in
question were unlike. I see no other possible way of clearing
up the disputed points of psychology. Psychology is a
science of experiences, and, therefore, it must proceed from
the individual to the general, and not, as in the supra-individualistic
laws of logic and ethics, proceed from the universal
to the individual case. There is no such thing as an
empirical general psychology; and it would be a mistake
to approach such without having fully reckoned with
differential psychology.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that psychology has been placed between
philosophy and the analysis of perceptions. From whichever
side psychologists approached the subject, they have
always been assured of the general validity of their results.<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
Perhaps even so fundamental a question as to whether or
no perception itself implies an actual and spontaneous act
of consciousness cannot be solved without a consideration
of characterological differences.</p>

<p>The purpose of this work is to apply characterology to
the solution of a few of these doubtful matters, with special
reference to the distinctions between the sexes. The different
conceptions of the I-problem, however, depend not so much
on differences of sex as on differences in giftedness. The
dispute between Hume and Kant receives its characterological
explanation much in the same way as if I were to distinguish
two men in so far as the one held in the highest
esteem the works of Makart and Gounod, the other those
of Rembrandt and Beethoven. I would simply distinguish
the two by their giftedness. So also the judgments about
the &#8220;I&#8221; must be very different in the cases of differently
gifted men. There have been no truly great men who were
not persuaded of the existence of the &#8220;I&#8221;; a man who
denies it cannot be a great man.</p>

<p>In the course of the following pages this proposition will
be taken as absolutely binding, and will be used really as a
means of valuing genius.</p>

<p>There has been no famous man who, at least some time
in the course of his life, and generally earlier in proportion
to his greatness, has not had a moment in which he was
absolutely convinced of the possession of an ego in the
highest sense.</p>

<p>Let us compare the following utterances of three very
great geniuses.</p>

<p>Jean Paul relates in his autobiographical sketch, &#8220;Truths
from my own Life&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never forget a circumstance which, so far, has
been related by no one&mdash;the birth of my own self-consciousness,
the time and place of which I can tell. One morning
I was standing, as a very young child, at the front door, and
looking towards the wood-shed I suddenly saw, all at once
my inner likeness. &#8216;I&#8217; am &#8216;I&#8217; flashed like lightning from
the skies across me, and since then has remained. I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
myself then for the first time and for ever. This cannot be
explained as a confusion of memory, for no alien narrative
could have blended itself with this sacred event, preserved
permanently in my memory by its vividness and novelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Novalis, in his &#8220;Miscellaneous Fragments,&#8221; refers to an
identical experience:</p>

<p>&#8220;This factor every one must experience for himself. It
is a factor of the higher order, and reveals itself only to
higher men; but men should strive to induce it in themselves.
Philosophy is the exercise of this factor, it is a
true self-revelation, the stimulation of the real ego by the
ideal ego. It is the foundation of all other revelations;
the resolution to philosophise is a challenge to the actual
ego, to become conscious of itself, to grow and to become
a soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schelling discusses the same phenomenon in his &#8220;Philosophical
Letters upon Dogmatism and Criticism,&#8221; a little
known early work, in which occur the following beautiful
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;In all of us there dwells a secret marvellous power of
freeing ourselves from the changes of time, of withdrawing to
our secret selves away from external things, and of so discovering
to ourselves the eternal in us in the form of unchangeability.
This presentation of ourselves to ourselves is the most
truly personal experience upon which depends everything
that we know of the supra-sensual world. This presentation
shows us for the first time what real existence is, whilst
all else only appears to be. It differs from every presentation
of the sense in its perfect freedom, whilst all other
presentations are bound, being overweighted by the burden
of the object. Still there exists for those who have not
this perfect freedom of the inner sense some approach to
it, experiences approaching it from which they may gain
some faint idea of it.... This intellectual presentation
occurs when we cease to be our own object, when, withdrawing
into ourselves, the perceiving self merges in the
self-perceived. At that moment we annihilate time and
duration of time; we are no longer in time, but time, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
rather eternity itself, is in us. The external world is no
longer an object for us, but is lost in us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The positivist will perhaps only laugh at the self-deceived
deceiver, the philosopher who asserts that he has had such
experiences. Well, it is not easy to prevent it. It is also
unnecessary. But I am by no means of the opinion that
this &#8220;factor of a higher order&#8221; plays the same part in all
men of genius of a mystical identity of subject and object
as Schelling describes it.</p>

<p>Whether there are undivided experiences in which the
dualism of actual life is overcome, as is indicated by Plotin
and the Indian Mahatmas, or whether this is only the
highest intensification of experience, but in principle similar
to all others&mdash;does not signify here, the coincidence of subject
and object, of time and eternity, the representing of
God through living men, will neither be demonstrated as
possible nor denied as impossible. The experiencing of
one&#8217;s own &#8220;I&#8221; is not to be begun by theoretical knowledge,
and no one has ever, so far, tried to put it in the position of
a systematic philosophy. I shall, therefore, not call this
factor of a higher order, which manifests itself in some men
in one way and in other men in another way, an essential
manifestation of the true ego, but only a phase of it.</p>

<p>Every great man knows this phase of the ego. He may
become conscious of it first through the love of a woman,
for the great man loves more intensely than the ordinary
man; or it may be from the contrast given by a sense of
guilt or the knowledge of having failed; these, too, the
great man feels more intensely than smaller-minded people.
It may lead him to a sense of unity with the all, to the
seeing of all things in God, or, and this is more likely, it
may reveal to him the frightful dualism of nature and spirit
in the universe, and produce in him the need, the craving,
for a solution of it, for the secret inner wonder. But always
it leads the great man to the beginning of a presentation of
the world for himself and by himself, without the help of
the thought of others.</p>

<p>This intuitive vision of the world is not a great synthesis<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
elaborated at his writing-table in his library from all the
books that have been written; it is something that has been
experienced, and as a whole it is clear and intelligible,
although details may still be obscure and contradictory.
The excitation of the ego is the only source of this intuitive
vision of the world as a whole in the case of the artist as in
that of the philosopher. And, however different they may
be, if they are really intuitive visions of the cosmos, they
have this in common, something that comes only from the
excitation of the ego, the faith that every great man possesses,
the conviction of his possession of an &#8220;I&#8221; or soul,
which is solitary in the universe, which faces the universe
and comprehends it.</p>

<p>From the time of this first excitation of his ego, the great
man, in spite of lapses due to the most terrible feeling, the
feeling of mortality, will live in and by his soul.</p>

<p>And it is for this reason, as well as from the sense of his
creative powers, that the great man has so intense a self-consciousness.
Nothing can be more unintelligent than to
talk of the modesty of great men, of their inability to recognise
what is within them. There is no great man who does
not well know how far he differs from others (except during
these periodical fits of depression to which I have already
alluded). Every great man feels himself to be great as soon
as he has created something; his vanity and ambition are,
in fact, always so great that he over-estimates himself.
Schopenhauer believed himself to be greater than Kant.
Nietzsche declared that &#8220;Thus spake Zarathustra&#8221; was the
greatest book in the world.</p>

<p>There is, however, a side of truth in the assertion that
great men are modest. They are never arrogant. Arrogance
and self-realisation are contradictories, and should
never be confused although this is often done. A man has
just as much arrogance as he lacks of self-realisation, and
uses it to increase his own self-consciousness by artificially
lowering his estimation of others. Of course the foregoing
holds true only of what may be called physiological,
unconscious arrogance; the great man must occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
comport himself with what seems rudeness to contemptible
persons.</p>

<p>All great men, then, have a conviction, really independent
of external proof, that they have a soul. The absurd fear
must be laid aside that the soul is a hyperempirical reality
and that belief in it leads us to the position of the theologists.
Belief in a soul is anything rather than a superstition
and is no mere handmaid of religious systems. Artists
speak of their souls although they have not studied
philosophy or theology; atheists like Shelley use the expression
and know very well what they mean by it.</p>

<p>Others have suggested that the &#8220;soul&#8221; is only a beautiful
empty word, which people ascribe to others without having
felt its need for themselves. This is like saying that great
artists use symbols to express the highest form of reality
without being assured as to the existence of that reality.
The mere empiricist and the pure physiologist no doubt
will consider that all this is nonsense, and that Lucretius is
the only great poet. No doubt there has been much misuse
of the word, but if great artists speak of their soul they
know what they are about. Artists, like philosophers, know
well when they approach the greatest possible reality, but
Hume had no sense of this.</p>

<p>The scientific man ranks, as I have already said, and as I
shall presently prove, below the artist and the philosopher.
The two latter may earn the title of genius which must
always be denied to the scientific man. Without any good
reason having been assigned for it, it has usually been the
case that the voice of genius on any particular problem is
listened to before the voice of science. Is there justice in
this preference? Can the genius explain things as to which
the man of science, as such, can say nothing? Can he
peer into depths where the man of science is blind?</p>

<p>The conception genius concludes universality. If there
were an absolute genius (a convenient fiction) there would
be nothing to which he could not have a vivid, intimate,
and complete relation. Genius, as I have already shown,
would have universal comprehension, and through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
perfect memory would be independent of time. To comprehend
anything one must have within one something
similar. A man notices, understands, and comprehends
only those things with which he has some kinship. The
genius is the man with the most intense, most vivid, most
conscious, most continuous, and most individual ego. The
ego is the central point, the unit of comprehension, the
synthesis of all manifoldness.</p>

<p>The ego of the genius accordingly is simply itself universal
comprehension, the centre of infinite space; the great man
contains the whole universe within himself; genius is the
living microcosm. He is not an intricate mosaic, a chemical
combination of an infinite number of elements; the argument
in chap. iv. as to his relation to other men and
things must not be taken in that sense; he is everything.
In him and through him all psychical manifestations cohere
and are real experiences, not an elaborate piece-work, a
whole put together from parts in the fashion of science.
For the genius the ego is the all, lives as the all; the genius
sees nature and all existences as whole; the relations of
things flash on him intuitively; he has not to build bridges
of stones between them. And so the genius cannot be an
empirical psychologist slowly collecting details and linking
them by associations; he cannot be a physicist, envisaging
the world as a compound of atoms and molecules.</p>

<p>It is absolutely from his vision of the whole, in which the
genius always lives, that he gets his sense of the parts. He
values everything within him or without him by the standard
of this vision, a vision that for him is no function of time,
but a part of eternity. And so the man of genius is the
profound man, and profound only in proportion to his
genius. That is why his views are more valuable than those
of all others. He constructs from everything his ego that
holds the universe, whilst others never reach a full consciousness
of this inner self, and so, for him, all things have
significance, all things are symbolical. For him breathing is
something more than the coming and going of gases
through the walls of the capillaries; the blue of the sky is<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
more than the partial polarisation of diffused and reflected
light; snakes are not merely reptiles that have lost limbs.
If it were possible for one single man to have achieved all
the scientific discoveries that have ever been made, if everything
that has been done by the following: Archimedes
and Lagrange, Johannes M&uuml;ller and Karl Ernst von Baer,
Newton and Laplace, Konrad Sprengel and Cuvier, Thucydides
and Niebuhr, Friedrich August Wolf and Franz Bopp,
and by many more famous men of science, could have been
achieved by one man in the short span of human life, he
would still not be entitled to the denomination of genius,
for none of these have pierced the depths. The scientist
takes phenomena for what they obviously are; the great
man or the genius for what they signify. Sea and mountain,
light and darkness, spring and autumn, cypress and
palm, dove and swan are symbols to him, he not only thinks
that there is, but he recognises in them something deeper.
The ride of the Valkyrie is not produced by atmospheric
pressure and the magic fire is not the outcome of a process
of oxidation.</p>

<p>And all this is possible for him because the outer world
is as full and strongly connected as the inner in him, the
external world in fact seems to be only a special aspect of
his inner life; the universe and the ego have become one in
him, and he is not obliged to set his experience together
piece by piece according to rule. The greatest poly-historian,
on the contrary, does nothing but add branch to
branch and yet creates no completed structure. That is
another reason why the great scientist is lower than the
great artist, the great philosopher. The infinity of the
universe is responded to in the genius by a true sense of
infinity in his own breast; he holds chaos and cosmos, all
details and all totality, all plurality, and all singularity in himself.
Although these remarks apply more to genius than to
the nature of the productions of genius, although the occurrence
of artistic ecstasy, philosophic conceptions, religious
fervour remain as puzzling as ever, if merely the conditions,
not the actual process of a really great achievement has<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
been made clearer, yet this is nevertheless to be the final
definition of genius:</p>

<p>A man may be called a genius when he lives in conscious
connection with the whole universe. It is only then that
the genius becomes the really divine spark in mankind.</p>

<p>The great idea of the soul of man as the microcosm, the
most important discovery of the philosophy of the
Renaissance&mdash;although traces of the idea are to be found in
Plato and Aristotle&mdash;appears to be quite disregarded by
modern thinkers since the death of Leibnitz. It has hitherto
been held as only holding good for genius, as the
prerogative of those masters of men.</p>

<p>But the incongruity is only apparent. All mankind have
some of the quality of genius, and no man has it entirely.
Genius is a condition to which one man draws close whilst
another is further away, which is attained by some in early
days, but with others only at the end of life.</p>

<p>The man to whom we have accorded the possession of
genius, is only he who has begun to see, and to open the
eyes of others. That they then can see with their own eyes
proves that they were only standing before the door.</p>

<p>Even the ordinary man, even as such, can stand in an
indirect relationship to everything: his idea of the &#8220;whole&#8221;
is only a glimpse, he does not succeed in identifying himself
with it. But he is not without the possibility of following
this identification in another, and so attaining a composite
image. Through some vision of the world he can bind
himself to the universal, and by diligent cultivation he can
make each detail a part of himself. Nothing is quite
strange to him, and in all a band of sympathy exists between
him and the things of the world. It is not so with plants
or animals. They are limited, they do not know the whole
but only one element; they do not populate the whole
earth, and where they are widely dispersed it is in the
service of man, who has allotted to them everywhere the
same task. They may have a relation to the sun or to the
moon, but they certainly are wanting in respect of the
&#8220;starry vault&#8221; and &#8220;the moral law.&#8221; For the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
originates in the soul of man, in which is hidden all
totality, which can see everything because it is universal
itself: the starry heavens and the moral law are fundamentally
one and the same. The universalism of the categorical
imperative is the universalism of the universe.</p>

<p>The infinity of the universe is only the &#8220;thought-picture&#8221;
of the infinity of the moral volition.</p>

<p>This was taught, the microcosm in man, by Empedocles
that mighty magician.</p>

<p>Man is the only creature, he is <i>the</i> creature in Nature,
that has in himself a relation to every thing.</p>

<p>He to whom this relationship brings understanding and
the most complete consciousness, not to many things or to
few things, but to all things, the man who of his own
individuality has thought out everything, is called a genius.
He in whom the possibility of this is present, in whom an
interest in everything could be aroused, yet who only, of
his own accord, concerns himself with a few, we call merely
a man.</p>

<p>The theory of Leibnitz, which is seldom rightly understood,
that the lower monads are a mirror of the world without
being conscious of this capacity of theirs, expresses the same
idea. The man of genius lives in a state of complete understanding,
an understanding of the whole; the whole world<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
is also in ordinary men, but not in a condition that can
become creative. The one lives in conscious active relation
with the whole, the other in an unconscious relation; the
man of genius is the actual, the common man the potential,
microcosm. The genius is the complete man; the manhood
that is latent in all men is in him fully developed.</p>

<p>Man himself is the All, and so unlike a mere part,
dependent on other parts; he is not assigned a definite
place in a system of natural laws, but he himself is the
meaning of the law and is therefore free, just as the world
whole being itself, the All does not condition itself but is
unconditioned. The man of genius is he who forgets nothing
because he does not forget himself, and because forgetting,
being a functional subjection to time, is neither free nor
ethical. He is not brought forward on the wave of a
historical movement as its child, to be swallowed up by the
next wave, because all, all the past and all the future is
contained in his inward vision. He it is whose consciousness
of immortality is most strong because the fear of death
has no terror for him. He it is who lives in the most
sympathetic relation to symbols and values because he weighs
and interprets by these all that is within him and all
that is outside him. He is the freest and the wisest and the
most moral of men, and for these reasons he suffers most of
all from what is still unconscious, what is chaos, what is
fatality within him.</p>

<p>How does the morality of great men reveal itself in their
relations to other men? This, according to the popular
view, is the only form which morality can assume, apart
from contraventions of the penal code. And certainly in
this respect, great men have displayed the most dubious
qualities. Have they not laid themselves open to accusations
of base ingratitude, extreme harshness, and much
worse faults?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that the greater an artist or philosopher
may be, the more ruthless he will be in keeping faith with
himself, in this very way often disappointing the expectations
of those with whom he comes in contact in every-day life;<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
these cannot follow his higher flights and so try to bind the
eagle to earth (Goethe and Lavater) and in this way many
great men have been branded as immoral.</p>

<p>Goethe, fortunately for himself, preserved a silence about
himself so complete that modern people who think that they
understand him completely as the light-living Olympian,
only know a few specks of him taken from his marvellous
delineation of Faust; we may be certain, none the less, that
he judged himself severely, and suffered in full measure for
the guilt he found in himself. And when an envious
N&ouml;rgler, who never grasped Schopenhauer&#8217;s doctrine of
detachment and the meaning of his Nirwana, throws the
reproach at the latter that he got the last value out of his
property, such a mean yelping requires no answer.</p>

<p>The statement that a great man is most moral towards
himself stands on sure ground; he will not allow alien
views to be imposed on him, so obscuring the judgment of
his own ego; he will not passively accept the interpretation
of another, of an alien ego, quite different from his own,
and if ever he has allowed himself to be influenced, the
thought will always be painful to him. A conscious lie that he
has told will harass him throughout his life, and he will be
unable to shake off the memory in Dionysian fashion. But
men of genius will suffer most when they become aware
afterwards that they have unconsciously helped to spread a
lie in their talk or conduct with others. Other men, who do
not possess this organic thirst for truth, are always deeply
involved in lies and errors, and so do not understand the
bitter revolt of great men against the &#8220;lies of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great man, he who stands high, he in whom the
ego, unconditioned by time, is dominant, seeks to maintain
his own value in the presence of his intelligible ego by his
intellectual and moral conscience. His pride is towards
himself; there is the desire in him to impress his own self
by his thoughts, actions, and creations. This pride is the
pride peculiar to genius, possessing its own standard of
value, and it is independent of the judgment of others,
since it possesses in itself a higher tribunal. Soft and<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
ascetic natures (Pascal is an example) sometimes suffer
from this self-pride, and yet try in vain to shake it off.
This self-pride will always be associated with pride before
others, but the two forms are really in perpetual conflict.</p>

<p>Can it be said that this strong adaptation to duty towards
oneself prejudices the sense of duty towards one&#8217;s neighbours?
Do not the two stand as alternatives, so that he
who always keeps faith with himself must break it with
others? By no means. As there is only one truth, so
there can be only one desire for truth&mdash;what Carlyle called
sincerity&mdash;that a man has or has not with regard both to
himself and to the world; it is never one of two, a view of
the world differing from a view of oneself, a self-study without
a world-study; there is only one duty and only one
morality. Man acts either morally or immorally, and if
he is moral towards himself he is moral towards others.</p>

<p>There are few regions of thought, however, so full of
false ideas, as the conception of moral duty towards one&#8217;s
neighbours and how it is to be fulfilled. Leaving out
of consideration, for the moment, the theoretical systems
of morality which are based on the maintenance of
human society, and which attach less importance to the
concrete feelings and motives at the moment of action than
to the effect on the general system of morality, we come
at once to the popular idea which defines the morality of
a man by his &#8220;goodness,&#8221; the degree to which his compassionate
disposition is developed. From the philosophical
point of view, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith saw in
sympathy the nature and source of all ethical conduct, and
this view received a very strong support from Schopenhauer&#8217;s
sympathetic morality. Schopenhauer&#8217;s &#8220;Essay on
the Foundations of Morality&#8221; shows in its motto &#8220;It is
easy to preach morality, difficult to find a basis for it,&#8221; the
fundamental error of the sympathetic ethics which always
fails to recognise that the science of ethics is not merely
an explanation and description of conduct, but a search
for a guide to it. Whoever will be at the pains diligently
to listen to the inner voice of man, in order to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
what he ought to do, will certainly reject every system of
ethics, the aim of which is to be a doctrine of the requirements
which man has invented for himself and others
instead of being a relation of what he actually does in
furthering these requirements or in stifling them. The
object of all moral science is not what is happening but
what ought to happen.</p>

<p>All attempts to explain ethics by psychology overlook the
fact that every psychic event in man is appraised by man
himself, and the appraiser of the psychic event cannot be
a psychic event. This standard can only be an idea, or
a value which is never fully realised, and which cannot
be altered by any experience because it remains constant,
even if all experience is in opposition to it. Moral conduct
can be only conduct controlled by an idea. And so we
can choose only from systems of morality which set up
some idea or maxim for the regulation of conduct, and
there are only two to choose from, the ethical socialism or
social ethics, founded by Bentham and Mill, but imported
to the Continent and diligently propagated in Germany and
Norway, and ethical individualism such as is taught by
Christianity and German idealism.</p>

<p>The second failure of all the systems of ethics founded
on sympathy is that they attempt to find a foundation for
morality, to explain morality, whilst the very conception of
morality is that it should be the ultimate standard of
human conduct, and so must be inexplicable and non-derivative,
must be its own purpose, and cannot be brought
into relation of cause and effect with anything outside
itself. This attempted derivation of morality is simply
another aspect of the purely descriptive, and therefore
necessarily, relative, ethics, and is untenable from the
fact that however diligently the search be made, it is
impossible to find in the sphere of causes and effects a
high aim that would be applicable to every moral action.
The inspiring motive of an action cannot come from any
nexus of cause and effect; it is much more in the nature of
things for cause and effect to be linked with an inspiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
moral aim. Outside the domain of first causes there lies a
domain of moral aims, and this latter domain is the inheritance
of mankind. The complete science of existence is
a linking together of first causes until the first cause of all
is reached, and a complete science of &#8220;oughts&#8221; leads to
a union of all in one great aim, the culminating moral
imperative.</p>

<p>He who rates sympathy as a positive moral factor has
treated as moral something that is a feeling, not an act.
Sympathy may be an ethical phenomenon, the expression
of something ethical, but it is no more an ethical
act than are the senses of shame and pride; we
must clearly distinguish between an ethical act and an
ethical phenomenon. Nothing must be considered an
ethical act that is not a confirmation of the ethical idea
by action; ethical phenomena are unpremeditated, involuntary
signs of a permanent tendency of the disposition
towards the moral idea. It is in the struggle between
motives that the idea presses in and seeks to make the
decision; the empirical mixture of ethical and unethical
feelings, sympathy and malice, self-confidence and presumption,
gives no help towards a conclusion. Sympathy is,
perhaps, the surest sign of a disposition, but it is not the
moral purpose inspiring an action. Morality must imply
conscious knowledge of the moral purpose and of value as
opposed to worthlessness. Socrates was right in this, and
Kant is the only modern philosopher who has followed
him. Sympathy is a non-logical sensation, and has no
claim to respect.</p>

<p>The question now before us is to consider how far a man
can act morally with regard to his fellow men.</p>

<p>It is certainly not by unsolicited help which obtrudes
itself on the solitude of another and pierces the limits that
he has set for himself; not by compassion but rather by
respect. This respect we owe only to man, as Kant
showed; for man is the only creature in the universe who
is a purpose to himself.</p>

<p>But how can I show a man my contempt, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
prove to him my respect? The first by ignoring him, the
second by being friendly with him.</p>

<p>How can I use him as a means to an end, and how can
I honour him by regarding him himself as an end? In the
first case, by looking upon him as a link in the chain of
circumstances with which I have to deal; in the second, by
endeavouring to understand him. It is only by interesting
oneself in a man, without exactly telling him so, by
thinking of him, by grasping his work, by sympathising
with his fate, and by seeking to understand him, that one
can respect one&#8217;s neighbour. Only he who, through his
own afflictions, has become unselfish, who forgets small
wranglings with his fellow man, who can repress his impatience,
and who endeavours to understand him, is really
disinterested with regard to his neighbour; and he behaves
morally because he triumphs over the strongest enemy to
his understanding of his neighbour&mdash;selfishness.</p>

<p>How does the famous man stand in this respect? He
who understands the most men, because he is most universal
in disposition, and who lives in the closest relation
to the universe at large, who most earnestly desires to
understand its purpose, will be most likely to act well
towards his neighbour.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, no one thinks so much or so intently
as he about other people (even although he has only seen
them for a moment), and no one tries so hard to understand
them if he does not feel that he already has them within
him in all their significance. Inasmuch as he has a continuous
past, a complete ego of his own, he can create the
past which he did not know for others. He follows the
strongest bent of his inner being if he thinks about them,
for he seeks only to come to the truth about them by
understanding them. He sees that human beings are all
members of an intelligible world, in which there is no
narrow egoism or altruism. This is the only explanation
of how it is that great men stand in vital, understanding
relationship, not only with those round about them, but
with all the personalities of history who have preceded them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
this is the only reason why great artists have grasped historical
personalities so much better and more intensively
than scientific historians. There has been no great man
who has not stood in a personal relationship to Napoleon,
Plato, or Mahomet. It is in this way that he shows his
respect and true reverence for those who have lived before
him. When many of those who have been intimate with
artists feel aggrieved when later on they recognise themselves
in their works; when writers are reproached for
treating everything as copy, it is easy enough to understand
the feeling. But the artist or author who does not heed the
littlenesses of mankind has committed no crime, he has
simply employed his creative act of understanding with
regard to them, by a single-minded representation and
reproduction of the world around him, and there can be no
higher relation between men than this. The following
words of Pascal, which have already been mentioned, are
specially applicable here: &#8220;A mesure qu&#8217;on a plus d&#8217;esprit,
on trouve qu&#8217;il y a plus d&#8217;hommes originaux. Les gens du
commun ne trouvent pas de diff&eacute;rence entre les hommes.&#8221;
It follows from the foregoing that the greater a man is the
greater efforts he will make to understand things that are
most strange to him, whilst the ordinary man readily thinks
that he understands a thing, although it may be something
he does not at all understand, so that he fails to perceive the
unfamiliar spirit which is appealing to him from some object
of art or from a philosophy, and at most attains a superficial
relation to the subject, but does not rise to the inspiration
of its creator. The great man who attains to the highest
rungs of consciousness does not easily identify himself and
his opinion with anything he reads, whilst those with a
lesser clarity of mind adopt, and imagine that they absorb,
things that in reality are very different. The man of genius
is he whose ego has acquired consciousness. He is enabled
by it to distinguish the fact that others are different, to
perceive the &#8220;ego&#8221; of other men, even when it is not pronounced
enough for them to be conscious of it themselves.
But it is only he who feels that every other man is also an<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
ego, a monad, an individual centre of the universe, with
specific manner of feeling and thinking and a distinct past,
he alone is in a position to avoid making use of his neighbours
as means to an end, he, according to the ethics of
Kant, will trace, anticipate, and therefore respect the personality
in his companion (as part of the intelligible
universe), and will not merely be scandalised by him. The
psychological condition of all practical altruism, therefore,
is theoretical individualism.</p>

<p>Here lies the bridge between moral conduct towards
oneself and moral conduct towards one&#8217;s neighbour, the
apparent want of which in the Kantian philosophy Schopenhauer
unjustly regarded as a fault, and asserted to arise
necessarily out of Kant&#8217;s first principles.</p>

<p>It is easy to give proofs. Only brutalised criminals and
insane persons take absolutely no interest in their fellow
men; they live as if they were alone in the world, and the
presence of strangers has no effect on them. But for him
who possesses a self there is a self in his neighbour, and
only the man who has lost the logical and ethical centre of
his being behaves to a second man as if the latter were not
a man and had no personality of his own. &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;thou&#8221;
are complementary terms. A man soonest gains consciousness
of himself when he is with other men. This is why a
man is prouder in the presence of other men than when he
is alone, whilst it is in his hours of solitude that his self-confidence
is damped. Lastly, he who destroys himself
destroys at the same time the whole universe, and he who
murders another commits the greatest crime because he
murders himself in his victim. Absolute selfishness is, in
practice, a horror, which should rather be called nihilism;
if there is no &#8220;thou,&#8221; there is certainly no &#8220;I,&#8221; and that
would mean there is nothing.</p>

<p>There is in the psychological disposition of the man of
genius that which makes it impossible to use other men as a
means to an end. And this is it: he who feels his own personality,
feels it also in others. For him the Tat-tvam-asi is
no beautiful hypothesis, but a reality. The highest individualism<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
is the highest universalism. Ernest Mach is in great
error when he denies the subject, and thinks it is only after
the renunciation of the individual &#8220;I&#8221; that an ethical relation,
which excludes neglect of the strange &#8220;I&#8221; and over-estimation
of the individual &#8220;I,&#8221; may be expected. It has
already been seen where the want of one&#8217;s own I leads in
relation to one&#8217;s neighbour. The I is the fundamental
ground of all social morality. I should never be able to
place myself, as an actual psychological being, in an ethical
relation to a mere bundle of elements. It is possible to
imagine such a relationship; but it is entirely opposed to
practical conduct; because it eliminates the psychological
condition necessary for making the moral idea an actual
reality.</p>

<p>We are preparing for a real ethical relation to our fellow
men when we make them conscious that each of them
possesses a higher self, a soul, and that they must realise
the souls in others.</p>

<p>This relation is, however, manifested in the most curious
manner in the man of genius. No one suffers so much as
he with the people, and, therefore, for the people, with whom
he lives. For, in a certain sense, it is certainly only &#8220;by
suffering&#8221; that a man knows. If compassion is not itself
clear, abstractly conceivable or visibly symbolic knowledge,
it is, at any rate, the strongest impulse for the acquisition of
knowledge. It is only by suffering that the genius understands
men. And the genius suffers most because he suffers
with and in each and all; but he suffers most through his
understanding.</p>

<p>Although I tried to show in an earlier chapter that genius
is the factor which primarily elevates man above the
animals, and in connection with that fact that it is man
alone who has a history (this being explained by the presence
in all men of some degree of the quality of genius),
I must return to that earlier side of my argument. Genius
involves the living actuality of the intelligible subject.
History manifests itself only as a social thing, as the &#8220;objective
spirit,&#8221; the individuals as such playing no part in it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
being, in fact, non-historical. Here we see the threads of
our argument converging. If it be the case, and I do not
think that I am wrong, that the timeless, human personality
is the necessary condition of every real ethical relation to
our fellow men, and if individuality is the necessary preliminary
to the collective spirit, then it is clear why the
&#8220;metaphysical animal&#8221; and the &#8220;political animal,&#8221; the
possessor of genius and the maker of history, are one
and the same, are humanity. And the old controversy is
settled; which comes first, the individual or the community?
Both must be equal and simultaneous.</p>

<p>I think that I have proved at every point that genius is
simply the higher morality. The great man is not only the
truest to himself, the most unforgetful, the one to whom
errors and lies are most hateful and intolerable; he is also
the most social, at the same time the most self-contained,
and the most open man. The genius is altogether a
higher form, not merely intellectually, but also morally.
In his own person, the genius reveals the idea of mankind.
He represents what man is; he is the subject
whose object is the whole universe which he makes endure
for all time.</p>

<p>Let there be no mistake. Consciousness and consciousness
alone is in itself moral; all unconsciousness is immoral,
and all immorality is unconscious. The &#8220;immoral genius,&#8221;
the &#8220;great wicked man,&#8221; is, therefore, a mythical animal,
invented by great men in certain moments of their lives as
a possibility, in order (very much against the will of the
Creator) to serve as a bogey for nervous and timid natures,
with which they frighten themselves and other children.
No criminal who prided himself in his deed would speak
like Hagen in the &#8220;G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung&#8221; over Siegfried&#8217;s dead
body: &#8220;Ha, ha, I have slain him; I, Hagen, gave him his
death blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Napoleon and Bacon, who are given as counter-instances,
were intellectually much over-rated or wrongly represented.
And Nietzsche is the least reliable in these matters, when he
begins to discuss the Borgia type. The conception of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
diabolical, of the anti-Christ, of Ahriman, of the &#8220;radical
evil in human nature,&#8221; is exceedingly powerful, yet it concerns
genius only inasmuch as it is the opposite of it. It
is a fiction, created in the hours in which great men have
struggled against the evil in themselves.</p>

<p>Universal comprehension, full consciousness, and perfect
timelessness are an ideal condition, ideal even for gifted
men; genius is an innate imperative, which never becomes
a fully accomplished fact in human beings. Hence it is
that a man of genius will be the last man to feel himself in
the position to say of himself: &#8220;I am a genius.&#8221; Genius
is, in its essence, nothing but the full completion of the
idea of a man, and, therefore, every man ought to have
some quality of it, and it should be regarded as a possible
principle for every one.</p>

<p>Genius is the highest morality, and, therefore, it is every
one&#8217;s duty. Genius is to be attained by a supreme act of
the will, in which the whole universe is affirmed in the
individual. Genius is something which &#8220;men of genius&#8221;
take upon themselves; it is the greatest exertion and the
greatest pride, the greatest misery and the greatest ecstasy
to a man. A man may become a genius if he wishes to.</p>

<p>But at once it will certainly be said: &#8220;Very many men
would like very much to be &#8216;original geniuses,&#8217;&#8221; and their
wish has no effect. But if these men who &#8220;would like very
much&#8221; had a livelier sense of what is signified by their
wish, if they were aware that genius is identical with universal
responsibility&mdash;and until that is grasped it will only
be a wish and not a determination&mdash;it is highly probable
that a very large number of these men would cease to wish
to become geniuses.</p>

<p>The reason why madness overtakes so many men of
genius&mdash;fools believe it comes from the influence of Venus,
or the spinal degeneration of neurasthenics&mdash;is that for
many the burden becomes too heavy, the task of bearing
the whole world on the shoulders, like Atlas, intolerable
for the smaller, but never for the really mighty minds.
But the higher a man mounts, the greater may be his<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
fall; all genius is a conquering of chaos, mystery, and
darkness, and if it degenerates and goes to pieces, the ruin
is greater in proportion to the success. The genius which
runs to madness is no longer genius; it has chosen happiness
instead of morality. All madness is the outcome of
the insupportability of suffering attached to all consciousness.
Sophocles derived his idea that a man might wish to
become mad for this reason, and lets Aias, whose mind
finally gives way, give utterance to these words:</p>

<p>I shall conclude this chapter with the solemn words,
similar to the best moments of Kant&#8217;s style, of Johann Pico
von Mirandola, to whom I may bring some measure of
recognition. In his address &#8220;on the dignity of man&#8221; the
Supreme Being addresses the following words to man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nec certam sedem, nec propriam faciem, nec munus
ullum peculiare tibi dedimus, O Adam: ut quam sedem,
quam faciem, quae munera tute optaveris, ea pro voto, pro
tua sententia, habeas et possideas. Definita caeteris natura
intra praescriptas a nobis leges coercetur; tu nullis angustiis
coercitus, pro tuo arbitrio, in cuius manu te posui,
tibi illam praefinies. Medium te mundi posui, ut circumspiceres
inde commodius quicquid est in mundo. Nec te
caelestem, neque terrenum, neque mortalem, neque immortalem
fecimus, ut tui ipsius quasi arbitrarius honorariusque
plastes et fictor in quam malueris tute formam
effingas. Poteris in inferiora quae sunt bruta degenerare,
poteris in superiora quae sunt divina, ex tui animi sententia
regenerari.</p>

<p>O summam Dei Patris liberalitatem, summam et admirandam
hominis felicitatem: cui datum id habere quod
optat, id esse quod velit. Bruta simul atque nascuntur
id secum afferunt e bulga matris, quod possessura sunt.
Supremi spiritus aut ab initio aut paulo mox id fuerunt,
quod sunt futuri in perpetuas aeternitates. <i>Nascenti homini

quae quisque excoluerit, illa adolescent et fructus suos<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
ferent in illo: si vegetalia, planta fiet, si sensualia, obbrutescet,
si rationalia, caeleste evadet animal, si intellectualia, angelus
erit et Dei filius. <i>Et si nulla creaturarum sorte contentus in
unitatis centrum suac se receperit, unus cum Deo spiritus factus,

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
MALE AND FEMALE PSYCHOLOGY</h3>

<p>It is now time to return to the actual subject of this investigation
in order to see how far its explanation has been
helped by the lengthy digressions, which must often have
seemed wide of the mark.</p>

<p>The consequences of the fundamental principles that have
been developed are of such radical importance to the psychology
of the sexes that, even if the former deductions have been
assented to, the present conclusions may find no acceptance.
This is not the place to analyse such a possibility; but in
order to protect the theory I am now going to set up, from
all objections, I shall fully substantiate it in the fullest possible
manner by convincing arguments.</p>

<p>Shortly speaking the matter stands as follows: I have
shown that logical and ethical phenomena come together in
the conception of truth as the ultimate good, and posit the
existence of an intelligible ego or a soul, as a form of being
of the highest super-empirical reality. In such a being as
the absolute female there are no logical and ethical phenomena,
and, therefore, the ground for the assumption of a
soul is absent. The absolute female knows neither the
logical nor the moral imperative, and the words law and
duty, duty towards herself, are words which are least
familiar to her. The inference that she is wanting in supersensual
personality is fully justified. The absolute female
has no ego.</p>

<p>In a certain sense this is an end of the investigation, a
final conclusion to which all analysis of the female leads.
And although this conclusion, put thus concisely, seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
harsh and intolerant, paradoxical and too abrupt in its
novelty, it must be remembered that the author is not the
first who has taken such a view; he is more in the position
of one who has discovered the philosophical grounds for an
opinion of long standing.</p>

<p>The Chinese from time immemorial have denied that
women possess a personal soul. If a Chinaman is asked
how many children he has, he counts only the boys, and
will say none if he has only daughters. Mahomet excluded
women from Paradise for the same reason, and on this
view depends the degraded position of women in Oriental
countries.</p>

<p>Amongst the philosophers, the opinions of Aristotle must
first be considered. He held that in procreation the male
principle was the formative active agent, the &#8220;logos,&#8221; whilst
the female was the passive material. When we remember
that Aristotle uses the word &#8220;soul&#8221; for the active, formative,
causative principle, it is plain that his idea was akin to
mine, although, as he actually expressed it, it related only
to the reproductive process; it is clear, moreover, that he,
like all the Greek philosophers except Euripides, paid no
heed to woman, and did not consider her qualities from
any other point of view than that of her share in reproduction.</p>

<p>Amongst the fathers of the Church, Tertullian and Origen
certainly had a very low opinion of woman, and St. Augustine,
except for his relations with his mother, seems to have
shared their view. At the Renaissance the Aristotelian conceptions
gained many new adherents, amongst whom Jean
Wier (1518-1588) may be cited specially. At that period
there was a general, more sensible and intuitive understanding
on the subject, which is now treated as merely
curious, contemporary science having bowed the knee to
other than Aristotelian gods.</p>

<p>In recent years Henrik Ibsen (in the characters of Anitra,
Rita, and Irene) and August Strindberg have given utterance
to this view. But the popularity of the idea of the
soullessness of woman has been most attained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
wonderful fairy tales of Fouqu&eacute;, who obtained the material
for them from Paracelsus, after deep study, and which have
been set to music by E. T. A. Hoffman, Girschner, and
Albert Lorzing.</p>

<p>Undine, the soulless Undine, is the platonic idea of
woman. In spite of all bi-sexuality she most really resembles
the actuality. The well-known phrase, &#8220;Women have no
character,&#8221; really means the same thing. Personality and
individuality (intelligible), ego and soul, will and (intelligible)
character, all these are different expressions of the
same actuality, an actuality the male of mankind attains, the
female lacks.</p>

<p>But since the soul of man is the microcosm, and great
men are those who live entirely in and through their souls,
the whole universe thus having its being in them, the female
must be described as absolutely without the quality of
genius. The male has everything within him, and, as Pico
of Mirandola put it, only specialises in this or that part of
himself. It is possible for him to attain to the loftiest
heights, or to sink to the lowest depths; he can become
like animals, or plants, or even like women, and so there
exist woman-like female men.</p>

<p>The woman, on the other hand, can never become a man.
In this consists the most important limitation to the assertions
in the first part of this work. Whilst I know of many
men who are practically completely psychically female, not
merely half so, and have seen a considerable number of
women with masculine traits, I have never yet seen a single
woman who was not fundamentally female, even when this
femaleness has been concealed by various accessories from
the person herself, not to speak of others. One must <i>be</i>
(<i>cf.</i> <a href="#Page1">chap. i. part I.</a>) either man or woman, however many
peculiarities of both sexes one may have, and this &#8220;<i>being</i>,&#8221;
the problem of this work from the start, is determined by
one&#8217;s relation to ethics and logic; but whilst there are
people who are anatomically men and psychically women,
there is no such thing as a person who is physically female
and psychically male, notwithstanding the extreme maleness<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
of their outward appearance and the unwomanliness of
their expression.</p>

<p>We may now give, with certainty, a conclusive answer to
the question as to the giftedness of the sexes: there are
women with undoubted traits of genius, but there is no
female genius, and there never has been one (not even
amongst those masculine women of history which were dealt
with in the first part), <i>and there never can be one</i>. Those
who are in favour of laxity in these matters, and are anxious
to extend and enlarge the idea of genius in order to make it
possible to include women, would simply by such action
destroy the conception of genius. If it is in any way possible
to frame a definition of genius that would thoroughly
cover the ground, I believe that my definition succeeds.
And how, then, could a soulless being possess genius?
The possession of genius is identical with profundity; and
if any one were to try to combine woman and profundity as
subject and predicate, he would be contradicted on all
sides. A female genius is a contradiction in terms, for
genius is simply intensified, perfectly developed, universally
conscious maleness.</p>

<p>The man of genius possesses, like everything else, the
complete female in himself; but woman herself is only a
part of the Universe, and the part can never be the whole;
femaleness can never include genius. This lack of genius
on the part of woman is inevitable because woman is not a
monad, and cannot reflect the Universe.<a id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote12"><a href="#FNanchor12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
It would be a simple matter to introduce at this point a list of
the works of the most famous women, and show by a few examples
how little they deserve the title of genius. But it would be a wearisome
task, and any one who would make use of such a list can
easily procure it for himself, so that I shall not do so.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The proof of the soullessness of woman is closely connected
with much of what was contained in the earlier
chapters. The third chapter explained that woman has
her experiences in the form of henids, whilst those of men
are in an organised form, so that the consciousness of the
female is lower in grade than that of the male. Consciousness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
however, is psychologically a fundamental part of the
theory of knowledge. From the point of view of the theory
of knowledge, consciousness and the possession of a continuous
ego, of a transcendental subjective soul, are identical
conceptions. Every ego exists only so far as it is self-conscious,
conscious of the contents of its own thoughts; all
real existence is conscious existence. I can now make an
important addition to the theory of henids. The organised
contents of the thoughts of the male are not merely those of
the female articulated and formed, they are not what was
potential in the female becoming actual; from the very first
there is a qualitative difference. The psychical contents of
the male, even whilst they are still in the henid stage that
they always try to emerge from, are already partly conceptual,
and it is probable that even perceptions in the male
have a direct tendency towards conceptions. In the female,
on the other hand, there is no trace of conception either in
recognition or in thinking.</p>

<p>The logical axioms are the foundation of all formation of
mental conceptions, and women are devoid of these; the
principle of identity is not for them an inevitable standard,
nor do they fence off all other possibilities from their conception
by using the principle of contradictories. This want
of definiteness in the ideas of women is the source of that
&#8220;sensitiveness&#8221; which gives the widest scope to vague associations
and allows the most radically different things to be
grouped together. And even women with the best and
least limited memories never free themselves from this kind
of association by feelings. For instance, if they &#8220;feel
reminded&#8221; by a word of some definite colour, or by a human
being of some definite thing to eat&mdash;forms of association
common with women&mdash;they rest content with the subjective
association, and do not try to find out the source of the
comparison, and if there is any relation in it to actual fact.
The complacency and self-satisfaction of women corresponds
with what has been called their intellectual
unscrupulousness, and will be referred to again in connection
with their want of the power to form concepts. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
subjection to waves of feeling, this want of respect for
conceptions, this self-appreciation without any attempt
to avoid shallowness, characterise as essentially female
the changeable styles of many modern painters and
novelists. Male thought is fundamentally different from
female thought in its craving for definite form, and
all art that consists of moods is essentially a formless
art.</p>

<p>The psychical contents of man&#8217;s thoughts, therefore, are
more than the explicit realisation of what women think in
henids. Woman&#8217;s thought is a sliding and gliding through
subjects, a superficial tasting of things that a man, who
studies the depths, would scarcely notice; it is an extravagant
and dainty method of skimming which has no grasp of
accuracy. A woman&#8217;s thought is superficial, and touch
is the most highly developed of the female senses, the
most notable characteristic of the woman which she can
bring to a high state by her unaided efforts. Touch necessitates
a limiting of the interest to superficialities, it is a vague
effect of the whole and does not depend on definite details.
When a woman &#8220;understands&#8221; a man (of the possibility or
impossibility of any real understanding I shall speak later)
she is simply, so to speak tasting (however wanting in
taste the comparison may be) what he has thought about
her. Since, on her own part, there is no sharp differentiation,
it is plain that she will often think that she herself has
been understood when there is no more present than a
vague similarity of perceptions. The incongruity between
the man and woman depends, in a special measure, on the
fact that the contents of the thoughts of the man are not
merely those of the woman in a higher state of differentiation,
but that the two have totally distinct sequences of
thought applied to the same object, conceptual thought in
the one and indistinct sensing in the other; and when
what is called &#8220;understanding&#8221; in the two cases is compared,
the comparison is not between a fully organised
integrated thought and a lower stage of the same process;
but in the understanding of man and woman there is on<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
the one side a conceptual thought, on the other side an
unconceptual &#8220;feeling,&#8221; a henid.</p>

<p>The unconceptual nature of the thinking of a woman is
simply the result of her less perfect consciousness, of her
want of an ego. It is the conception that unites the mere
complex of perceptions into an object, and this it does
independently of the presence of an actual perception. The
existence of the complex of perceptions is dependent on the
will; the will can shut the eyes and stop the ears so that the
person no longer sees nor hears, but may get drunk or go to
sleep and forget. It is the conception which brings freedom
from the eternally subjective, eternally psychological relativity
of the actual perceptions, and which creates the
things in themselves. By its power of forming conceptions
the intellect can spontaneously separate itself from the
object; conversely, it is only when there is a comprehending
function that subject and object can be separated and so
distinguished; in all other cases there is only a mass of like
and unlike images present mingling together without law
and order. The conception creates definite realities from the
floating images, the object from the perception, the object
which stands like an enemy opposite the subject that the
subject may measure its strength upon it. The conception
is thus the creator of reality; it is the &#8220;transcendental
object&#8221; of Kant&#8217;s &#8220;Critique of Reason,&#8221; but it always
involves a transcendental &#8220;subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is impossible to say of a mere complex of perceptions
that it is like itself; in the moment that I have made the
judgment of identity, the complex of perceptions has
become a concept. And so the conception gives their
value to all processes of verification and all syllogisms;
the conception makes the contents of thought free by binding
them. It gives freedom both to the subject and object;
for the two freedoms involve each other. All freedom is
in reality self-binding, both in logic and in ethics. Man is
free only when he himself is the law. And so the function
of making concepts is the power by which man gives himself
dignity; he honours himself by giving freedom to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
objective world, by making it part of the objective body of
knowledge to which recourse may be had when two men
differ. The woman cannot in this way set herself over
against realities, she and they swing together capriciously;
she cannot give freedom to her objects as she herself is not
free.</p>

<p>The mode in which perceptions acquire independence in
conceptions is the means of getting free from subjectivity.
The conception is that about which I think, write, and
speak. And in this way there comes the belief that I can
make judgments concerning it. Hume, Huxley, and other
&#8220;immanent&#8221; psychologists, tried to identify the conception
with a mere generalisation, so making no distinction
between logical and psychological thought. In doing this
they ignored the power of making judgments. In every
judgment there is an act of verification or of contradiction,
an approval or rejection, and the standard for these judgments,
the idea of truth, must be something external to that
on what it is acting. If there are nothing but perceptions,
then all perceptions must have an equal validity, and there
can be no standard by which to form a real world.
Empiricism in this fashion really destroys the reality of
experience, and what is called positivism is no more than
nihilism. The idea of a standard of truth, the idea of
truth, cannot lie in experience. In every judgment this
idea of the existence of truth is implicit. The claim to
real knowledge depends on this capacity to judge,
involves the conception of the possibility of truth in the
judgment.</p>

<p>This claim to be able to reach knowledge is no more
than to say that the subject can judge of the object, can
say that the object is true. The objects on which we make
judgments are conceptions; the conception is what we know.
The conception places a subject and an object against one
another, and the judgment then creates a relation between
the two. The attainment of truth simply means that the
subject can judge rightly of the object, and so the function
of making judgments is what places the ego in relation to<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
the all, is what makes a real unity of the ego and the all
possible. And thus we reach an answer to the old problem
as to whether conception or judgment has precedence; the
answer is that the two are necessary to one another. The
faculty of making conceptions cleaves subject and object
and unites them again.</p>

<p>A being like the female, without the power of making concepts,
is unable to make judgments. In her &#8220;mind&#8221; subjective
and objective are not separated; there is no possibility of
making judgments, and no possibility of reaching, or of
desiring, truth. No woman is really interested in science;
she may deceive herself and many good men, but bad
psychologists, by thinking so. It may be taken as certain,
that whenever a woman has done something of any little
importance in the scientific world (Sophie Germain, Mary
Somerville, &amp;c.) it is always because of some man in the
background whom they desire to please in this way; and
it is more often justifiable to say &#8220;cherchez l&#8217;homme&#8221;
where women are concerned than &#8220;cherchez la femme&#8221; in
the case of men.</p>

<p>But there have never been any great discoveries in the
world of science made by women, because the facility for
truth only proceeds from a desire for truth, and the former
is always in proportion to the latter. Woman&#8217;s sense of
reality is much less than man&#8217;s, in spite of much repetition
of the contrary opinion. With women the pursuit of knowledge
is always subordinated to something else, and if this
alien impulse is sufficiently strong they can see sharply and
unerringly, but woman will never be able to see the value
of truth in itself and in relation to her own self. Where
there is some check to what she wishes (perhaps unconsciously)
a woman becomes quite uncritical and loses all
touch with reality. This is why women so often believe
themselves to have been the victims of sexual overtures;
this is the reason of extreme frequency of hallucinations
of the sense of touch in women, of the intensive reality of
which it is almost impossible for a man to form an idea.
This also is why the imagination of women is composed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
lies and errors, whilst the imagination of the philosopher is
the highest form of truth.</p>

<p>The idea of truth is the foundation of everything that
deserves the name of judgment. Knowledge is simply the
making of judgments, and thought itself is simply another
name for judgment. Deduction is the necessary process in
making judgments, and involves the propositions of identity
and of contradictories, and, as I have shown, these propositions
are not axiomatic for women.</p>

<p>A psychological proof that the power of making judgments
is a masculine trait lies in the fact that the woman
recognises it as such, and that it acts on her as a tertiary
sexual character of the male. A woman always expects
definite convictions in a man, and appropriates them; she
has no understanding of indecision in a man. She always
expects a man to talk, and a man&#8217;s speech is to her a sign of
his manliness. It is true that woman has the gift of speech,
but she has not the art of talking; she converses (flirts) or
chatters, but she does not talk. She is most dangerous,
however, when she is dumb, for men are only too inclined
to take her quiescence for silence.</p>

<p>The absolute female, then, is devoid not only of the
logical rules, but of the functions of making concepts and
judgments which depend on them. As the very nature of
the conceptual faculty consists in posing subject against
object, and as the subject takes its deepest and fullest meaning
from its power of forming judgments on its objects, it is
clear that women cannot be recognised as possessing even
the subject.</p>

<p>I must add to the exposition of the non-logical nature of
the female some statements as to her non-moral nature.
The profound falseness of woman, the result of the want in
her of a permanent relation to the idea of truth or to the idea
of value, would prove a subject of discussion so exhaustive
that I must go to work another way. There are such
endless imitations of ethics, such confusing copies of morality,
that women are often said to be on a moral plane higher
than that of man. I have already pointed out the need to<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
distinguish between the non-moral and the immoral, and I
now repeat that with regard to women we can talk only of
the non-moral, of the complete absence of a moral sense.
It is a well-known fact of criminal statistics and of daily life
that there are very few female criminals. The apologists of
the morality of women always point to this fact.</p>

<p>But in deciding the question as to the morality of women
we have to consider not if a particular person has objectively
sinned against the idea, but if the person has or has not a
subjective centre of being that can enter into a relation with
the idea, a relation the value of which is lowered when a
sin is committed. No doubt the male criminal inherits his
criminal instincts, but none the less he is conscious&mdash;in
spite of theories of &#8220;moral insanity&#8221;&mdash;that by his action he
has lowered the value of his claim on life. All criminals
are cowardly in this matter, and there is none of them that
thinks he has raised his value and his self-consciousness by
his crime, or that would try to justify it to himself.</p>

<p>The male criminal has from birth a relation to the idea
of value just like any other man, but the criminal impulse,
when it succeeds in dominating him, destroys this almost
completely. Woman, on the contrary, often believes herself
to have acted justly when, as a matter of fact, she has
just done the greatest possible act of meanness; whilst the
true criminal remains mute before reproach, a woman can
at once give indignant expression to her astonishment and
anger that any one should question her perfect right to act
in this or that way. Women are convinced of their own
integrity without ever having sat in judgment on it. The
criminal does not, it is true, reflect on himself, but he never
urges his own integrity; he is much more inclined to get
rid of the thought of his integrity,<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> because it might remind
him of his guilt: and in this is the proof that he had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
relation to the idea (of truth), and only objects to be reminded
of his unfaithfulness to his better self. No male
criminal has ever believed that his punishment was unjust.
A woman, on the contrary, is convinced of the animosity of
her accuser, and if she does not wish to be convinced of it,
no one can persuade her that she has done wrong.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote13"><a href="#FNanchor13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> A male criminal even feels guilty when he has not actually
done wrong. He can always accept the reproaches of others as to
deception, thieving, and so on, even if he has never committed such
acts, because he knows he is capable of them. So also he always
feels himself &#8220;caught&#8221; when any other offender is arrested.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If any one talks to her it usually happens that she bursts
into tears, begs for pardon, and &#8220;confesses her fault,&#8221; and
may really believe that she feels her guilt; but only when she
desires to do so, and the outbreak of tears has given her a
certain sort of satisfaction. The male criminal is callous;
he does not spin round in a trice, as a woman would do in
a similar instance if her accuser knew how to handle her
skilfully.</p>

<p>The personal torture which arises from guilt, which cries
aloud in its anguish at having brought such a stain upon
herself, no woman knows, and an apparent exception (the
penitent, who becomes a self-mortifying devotee,) will certainly
prove that a woman only feels a vicarious guilt.</p>

<p>I am not arguing that woman is evil and anti-moral; I
state that she cannot be really evil; <i>she is merely non-moral</i>.</p>

<p>Womanly compassion and female modesty are the two
other phenomena which are generally urged by the defenders
of female virtue. It is especially from womanly kindness,
womanly sympathy, that the beautiful descriptions of the
soul of woman have gained most support, and the final
argument of all belief in the superior morality of woman is
the conception of her as the hospital nurse, the tender
sister. I am sorry to have to mention this point, and should
not have done so, but I have been forced to do so by a
verbal objection made to me, which can be easily foreseen.</p>

<p>It is very shortsighted of any one to consider the nurse
as a proof of the sympathy of women, because it really
implies the opposite. For a man could never stand the
sight of the sufferings of the sick; he would suffer so
intensely that he would be completely upset and incapable
of lengthy attendance on them. Any one who has watched
nursing sisters is astounded at their equanimity and &#8220;sweetness&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
even in the presence of most terrible death throes;
and it is well that it is so, for man, who cannot stand suffering
and death, would make a very bad nurse. A man would
want to assuage the pain and ward off death; in a word, he
would want to <i>help</i>; where there is nothing to be done he is
better away; it is only then that nursing is justified and that
woman offers herself for it. But it would be quite wrong
to regard this capacity of women in an ethical aspect.</p>

<p>Here it may be said that for woman the problem of solitude
and society does not exist. She is well adapted for
social relations (as, for instance, those of a companion or
sick-nurse), simply because for her there is no transition
from solitude to society. In the case of a man, the choice
between solitude and society is serious when it has to be
made. The woman gives up no solitude when she nurses
the sick, as she would have to do were she to deserve moral
credit for her action; a woman is never in a condition of
solitude, and knows neither the love of it nor the fear of it.
The woman is always living in a condition of fusion with all
the human beings she knows, even when she is alone; she
is not a &#8220;monad,&#8221; for all monads are sharply marked off
from other existences. Women have no definite individual
limits; they are not unlimited in the sense that geniuses
have no limits, being one with the whole world; they are
unlimited only in the sense that they are not marked off
from the common stock of mankind.</p>

<p>This sense of continuity with the rest of mankind is a
sexual character of the female, and displays itself in the
desire to touch, to be in contact with, the object of her
pity; the mode in which her tenderness expresses itself is
a kind of animal sense of contact. It shows the absence of
the sharp line that separates one real personality from
another. The woman does not respect the sorrow of her
neighbour by silence; she tries to raise him from his grief
by speech, feeling that she must be in physical, rather than
spiritual contact with him.</p>

<p>This diffused life, one of the most fundamental qualities
of the female nature, is the cause of the impressibility of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
women, their unreserved and shameless readiness to shed
tears on the most ordinary occasion. It is not without
reason that we associate wailing with women, and think
little of a man who sheds tears in public. A woman weeps
with those that weep and laughs with those that laugh&mdash;unless
she herself is the cause of the laughter&mdash;so that the
greater part of female sympathy is ready-made.</p>

<p>It is only women who demand pity from other people,
who weep before them and claim their sympathy. This is
one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the psychical
shamelessness of women. A woman provokes the compassion
of strangers in order to weep with them and be able to
pity herself more than she already does. It is not too much
to say that even when a woman weeps alone she is weeping
with those that she knows would pity her and so intensifying
her self-pity by the thought of the pity of others. Self-pity
is eminently a female characteristic; a woman will
associate herself with others, make herself the object of
pity for these others, and then at once, deeply stirred,
begin to weep with them about herself, the poor thing.
Perhaps nothing so stirs the feeling of shame in a man
as to detect in himself the impulse towards this self-pity,
this state of mind in which the subject becomes the
object.</p>

<p>As Schopenhauer put it, female sympathy is a matter of
sobbing and wailing on the slightest provocation, without
the smallest attempt to control the emotion; on the other
hand, all true sorrow, like true sympathy, just because it is
real sorrow, must be reserved; no sorrow can really be so
reserved as sympathy and love, for these make us most
fully conscious of the limits of each personality. Love
and its bashfulness will be considered later on; in the
meantime let us be assured that in sympathy, in genuine
masculine sympathy, there is always a strong feeling of
reserve, a sense almost of guilt, because one&#8217;s friend is
worse off than oneself, because I am not he, but a being
separated from his being by extraneous circumstances. A
man&#8217;s sympathy is the principle of individuality blushing for<span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span>
itself; and hence man&#8217;s sympathy is reserved whilst that
of woman is aggressive.</p>

<p>The existence of modesty in women has been discussed
already to a certain extent; I shall have more to say about
it in relation with hysteria. But it is difficult to see how it
can be maintained that this is a female virtue, if one reflect
on the readiness with which women accept the habit of
wearing low-necked dresses wherever custom prescribes it.
A person is either modest or immodest, and modesty is not
a quality which can be assumed or discarded from hour to
hour.</p>

<p>Strong evidence of the want of modesty in woman is to
be derived from the fact that women dress and undress in
the presence of one another with the greatest freedom,
whilst men try to avoid similar circumstances. Moreover,
when women are alone together, they are very ready to
discuss their physical qualities, especially with regard to
their attractiveness for men; whilst men, practically without
exception, avoid all notice of one another&#8217;s sexual
characters.</p>

<p>I shall return to this subject again. In the meantime I
wish to refer to the argument of the second chapter in this
connection. One must be fully conscious of a thing before
one can have a feeling of shame about it, and so differentiation
is as necessary for the sense of shame as for consciousness.
The female, who is only sexual, can appear to be
asexual because she is sexuality itself, and so her sexuality
does not stand out separately from the rest of her being,
either in space or in time, as in the case of the male.
Woman can give an impression of being modest because
there is nothing in her to contrast with her sexuality. And
so the woman is always naked or never naked&mdash;we may
express it either way&mdash;never naked, because the true feeling
of nakedness is impossible to her; always naked, because
there is not in her the material for the sense of relativity by
which she could become aware of her nakedness and so
make possible the desire to cover it.</p>

<p>What I have been discussing depends on the actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
meaning of the word &#8220;ego&#8221; to a woman. If a woman
were asked what she meant by her &#8220;ego&#8221; she would certainly
think of her body. Her superficies, that is the
woman&#8217;s ego. The ego of the female is quite correctly
described by Mach in his &#8220;Anti-metaphysical Remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ego of a woman is the cause of the vanity which is
specific of women. The analogue of this in the male is an
emanation of the set of his will towards his conception of
the good, and its objective expression is a sensitiveness, a
desire that no one shall call in question the possibility of
attaining this supreme good. It is his personality that
gives to man his value and his freedom from the conditions
of time. This supreme good, which is beyond price, because,
in the words of Kant, there can be found no equivalent for
it, is the dignity of man. Women, in spite of what Schiller
has said, have no dignity, and the word &#8220;lady&#8221; was
invented to supply this defect, and her pride will find its
expression in what she regards as the supreme good, that is
to say, in the preservation, improvement, and display of her
personal beauty. The pride of the female is something
quite peculiar to herself, something foreign even to the
most handsome man, an obsession by her own body; a
pleasure which displays itself, even in the least handsome
girl, by admiring herself in the mirror, by stroking herself
and playing with her own hair, but which comes to its full
measure only in the effect that her body has on man. A
woman has no true solitude, because she is always conscious
of herself only in relation to others. The other side of the
vanity of women is the desire to feel that her body is
admired, or, rather, sexually coveted, by a man.</p>

<p>This desire is so strong that there are many women to
whom it is sufficient merely to know that they are coveted.</p>

<p>The vanity of women is, then, always in relation to others;
a woman lives only in the thoughts of others about her.
The sensibility of women is directed to this. A woman
never forgets that some one thought her ugly; a woman
never considers herself ugly; the successes of others at the
most only make her think of herself as perhaps less attractive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
But no woman ever believes herself to be anything
but beautiful and desirable when she looks at herself in the
glass; she never accepts her own ugliness as a painful
reality as a man would, and never ceases to try to persuade
others of the contrary.</p>

<p>What is the source of this form of vanity, peculiar to the
female? It comes from the absence of an intelligible ego,
the only begetter of a constant and positive sense of value;
it is, in fact, that she is devoid of a sense of personal value.
As she sets no store by herself or on herself, she endeavours
to attain to a value in the eyes of others by exciting their
desire and admiration. The only thing which has any
absolute and ultimate value in the world is the soul. &#8220;Ye
are better than many sparrows&#8221; were Christ&#8217;s words to
mankind. A woman does not value herself by the constancy
and freedom of her personality; but this is the only possible
method for every creature possessing an ego. But if a real
woman, and this is certainly the case, can only value herself
at the rate of the man who has fixed his choice on her; if it
is only through her husband or lover that she can attain to
a value not only in social and material things, but also in
her innermost nature, it follows that she possesses no personal
value, she is devoid of man&#8217;s sense of the value of
his own personality for itself. And so women always get
their sense of value from something outside themselves,
from their money or estates, the number and richness of
their garments, the position of their box at the opera, their
children, and, above all, their husbands or lovers. When a
woman is quarrelling with another woman, her final weapon,
and the weapon she finds most effective and discomfiting, is
to proclaim her superior social position, her wealth or title,
and, above all, her youthfulness and the devotion of her
husband or lover; whereas a man in similar case would lay
himself open to contempt if he relied on anything except
his own personal individuality.</p>

<p>The absence of the soul in woman may also be inferred
from the following: Whilst a woman is stimulated to try to
impress a man from the mere fact that he has paid no<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
attention to her (Goethe gave this as a practical receipt), the
whole life of a woman, in fact, being an expression of this
side of her nature, a man, if a woman treats him rudely or
indifferently, feels repelled by her. Nothing makes a man
so happy as the love of a girl; even if he did not at first
return her love, there is a great probability of love being
aroused in him. The love of a man for whom she does not
care is only a gratification of the vanity of a woman, or an
awakening and rousing of slumbering desires. A woman
extends her claims equally to all men on earth.</p>

<p>The shamelessness and heartlessness of women are shown
in the way in which they talk of being loved. A man feels
ashamed of being loved, because he is always in the position
of being the active, free agent, and because he knows that
he can never give himself entirely to love, and there is
nothing about which he is so silent, even when there is no
special reason for him to fear that he might compromise
the lady by talking. A woman boasts about her love affairs,
and parades them before other women in order to make
them envious of her. Woman does not look upon a man&#8217;s
inclination for her so much as a tribute to her actual worth,
or a deep insight into her nature, as the bestowing a value
on her which she otherwise would not have, as the gift to
her of an existence and essence with which she justifies
herself before others.</p>

<p>The remark in an earlier chapter about the unfailing
memory of woman for all the compliments she has ever
received since childhood is explained by the foregoing facts.
It is from compliments, first of all, that woman gets a sense
of her &#8220;value,&#8221; and that is why women expect men to be
&#8220;polite.&#8221; Politeness is the easiest form of pleasing a woman,
and however little it costs a man it is dear to a woman,
who never forgets an attention, and lives upon the most
insipid flattery, even in her old age. One only remembers
what possesses a value in one&#8217;s eyes; it may safely be said
that it is for compliments women have the most developed
memory. The woman can attain a sense of value by these
external aids, because she does not possess within her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
inner standard of value which diminishes everything outside
her. The phenomena of courtesy and chivalry are simply
additional proofs that women have no souls, and that when
a man is being &#8220;polite&#8221; to a woman he is simply ascribing
to her the minimum sense of personal value, a form of
deference to which importance is attached precisely in the
measure that it is misunderstood.</p>

<p>The non-moral nature of woman reveals itself in the mode
in which she can so easily forget an immoral action she has
committed. It is almost characteristic of a woman that she
cannot believe that she has done wrong, and so is able to
deceive both herself and her husband. Men, on the other
hand, remember nothing so well as the guilty episodes of
their lives. Here memory reveals itself as eminently a
moral phenomenon. Forgiving and forgetting, not forgiving
and understanding, go together. When one remembers a
lie, one reproaches oneself afresh about it. A woman
forgets, because she does not blame herself for an act of
meanness, because she does not understand it, having no
relation to the moral idea. It is not surprising that she is
ready to lie. Women have been regarded as virtuous,
simply because the problem of morality has not presented
itself to them; they have been held to be even more moral
than man; this is simply because they do not understand
immorality. The innocence of a child is not meritorious;
if a patriarch could be innocent he might be praised for it.</p>

<p>Introspection is an attribute confined to males, if we leave
out of account the hysterical self-reproaches of certain
women&mdash;and consciousness of guilt and repentance are
equally male. The penances that women lay on themselves,
remarkable imitations of the sense of guilt, will be discussed
when I come to deal with what passes for introspection in
the female sex. The &#8220;subject&#8221; of introspection is the moral
agent; it has a relation to psychical phenomena only in so
far as it sits in judgment on them.</p>

<p>It is quite in the nature of positivism that Comte denies
the possibility of introspection, and throws ridicule on
it. For certainly it is absurd that a psychical event and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
judgment of it could coincide if the interpretations of the
positivists be accepted. It is only on the assumption that
there exists an ego unconditioned by time and intrinsically
capable of moral judgments, endowed with memory and
with the power of making comparisons, that we can justify
the belief in the possibility of introspection.</p>

<p>If woman had a sense of her personal value and the will
to defend it against all external attacks she could not be
jealous. Apparently all women are jealous, and jealousy
depends on the failure to recognise the rights of others.
Even the jealousy of a mother when she sees another
woman&#8217;s daughters married before her own depends simply
on her want of the sense of justice.</p>

<p>Without justice there can be no society, so that jealousy
is an absolutely unsocial quality. The formation of societies
in reality presupposes the existence of true individuality.
Woman has no faculty for the affairs of State or politics, as
she has no social inclinations; and women&#8217;s societies, from
which men are excluded, are certain to break up after a
short time. The family itself is not really a social structure;
it is essentially unsocial, and men who give up their clubs
and societies after marriage soon rejoin them. I had
written this before the appearance of Heinrich Schurtz&#8217;
valuable ethnological work, in which he shows that associations
of men, and not the family, form the beginnings of
society.</p>

<p>Pascal made the wonderful remark that human beings
seek society only because they cannot bear solitude and
wish to forget themselves. It is the fact expressed in these
words which puts in harmony my earlier statement that
women had not the faculty of solitude and my present
statement that she is essentially unsociable.</p>

<p>If a woman possessed an &#8220;ego&#8221; she would have the
sense of property both in her own case and that of others.
The thieving instinct, however, is much more developed in
men than in women. So-called &#8220;kleptomaniacs&#8221; (those
who steal without necessity) are almost exclusively women.
Women understand power and riches but not personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
property. When the thefts of female kleptomaniacs are
discovered, the women defend themselves by saying that it
appeared to them as if everything belonged to them. It is
chiefly women who use circulating libraries, especially those
who could quite well afford to buy quantities of books; but,
as matter of fact, they are not more strongly attracted by
what they have bought than by what they have borrowed.
In all these matters the relation between individuality and
society comes into view; just as a man must have personality
himself to appreciate the personalities of others, so
also he must acquire a sense of personal right in his own
property to respect the rights of others.</p>

<p>One&#8217;s name and a strong devotion to it are even more
dependent on personality than is the sense of property.
The facts that confront us with reference to this are so
salient that it is extraordinary to find so little notice taken
of them. Women are not bound to their names with any
strong bond. When they marry they give up their own
name and assume that of their husband without any sense
of loss. They allow their husbands and lovers to call them
by new names, delighting in them; and even when a
woman marries a man that she does not love, she has never
been known to suffer any psychical shock at the change of
name. The name is a symbol of individuality; it is only
amongst the lowest races on the face of the earth, such as
the bushmen of South Africa, that there are no personal
names, because amongst such as these the desire for distinguishing
individuals from the general stock is not felt. The
fundamental namelessness of the woman is simply a sign of
her undifferentiated personality.</p>

<p>An important observation may be mentioned here and
may be confirmed by every one. Whenever a man enters
a place where a woman is, and she observes him, or hears
his step, or even only guesses he is near, she becomes
another person. Her expression and her pose change with
incredible swiftness; she &#8220;arranges her fringe&#8221; and her
bodice, and rises, or pretends to be engrossed in her work.
She is full of a half-shameless, half-nervous expectation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
In many cases one is only in doubt as to whether she is
blushing for her shameless laugh, or laughing over her
shameless blushing.</p>

<p>The soul, personality, character&mdash;as Schopenhauer with
marvellous sight recognised&mdash;are identical with free-will.
And as the female has no ego, she has no free-will. Only
a creature with no will of its own, no character in the
highest sense, could be so easily influenced by the mere
proximity to a man as woman is, who remains in functional
dependence on him instead of in free relationship to him.
Woman is the best medium, the male her best hypnotiser.
For this reason alone it is inconceivable why women can
be considered good as doctors; for many doctors admit
that their principal work up to the present&mdash;and it will
always be the same&mdash;lies in the suggestive influence on
their patients.</p>

<p>The female is uniformly more easily hypnotised than the
male throughout the animal world, and it may be seen from
the following how closely hypnotic phenomena are related
to the most ordinary events. I have already described, in
discussing female sympathy, how easy it is for laughter or
tears to be induced in females. How impressed she is by
everything in the newspapers! What a martyr she is to the
silliest superstitions! How eagerly she tries every remedy
recommended by her friends!</p>

<p>Whoever is lacking in character is lacking in convictions.
The female, therefore, is credulous, uncritical, and quite unable
to understand Protestantism. Christians are Catholics
or Protestants before they are baptized, but, none the less,
it would be unfair to describe Catholicism as feminine
simply because it suits women better. The distinction
between the Catholic and Protestant dispositions is a side
of characterology that would require separate treatment.</p>

<p>It has been exhaustively proved that the female is soulless
and possesses neither ego nor individuality, personality nor
freedom, character nor will. This conclusion is of the
highest significance in psychology. It implies that the
psychology of the male and of the female must be treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
separately. A purely empirical representation of the psychic
life of the female is possible; in the case of the male, all the
psychic life must be considered with reference to the ego,
as Kant foresaw.</p>

<p>The view of Hume (and Mach), which only admits that
there are &#8220;impressions&#8221; and &#8220;thoughts&#8221; (ABC and
&#945; &#946; &#947; ...), and which has almost driven the psyche out of
present day psychology, declares that the whole world is
to be considered exclusively as a picture in a reflector, a
sort of kaleidoscope; it merely reduces everything to a
dance of the &#8220;elements,&#8221; without thought or order; it denies
the possibility of obtaining a secure standpoint for thought;
it not only destroys the idea of truth, and accordingly of
reality, the only claims on which philosophy rests, but
it also is to blame for the wretched plight of modern
psychology.</p>

<p>This modern psychology proudly styles itself the &#8220;psychology
without the soul,&#8221; in imitation of its much over-rated
founder, Friedrich Albert Lange. I think I have
proved in this work that without the acknowledgment of a
soul there would be no way of dealing with psychic phenomena;
just as much in the case of the male who has a soul
as in the case of the female who is soulless.</p>

<p>Modern psychology is eminently womanish, and that is
why this comparative investigation of the sexes is so specially
instructive, and it is not without reason that I have delayed
pointing out this radical difference; it is only now that it
can be seen what the acceptation of the ego implies, and
how the confusing of masculine and feminine spiritual life
(in the broadest and deepest sense) has been at the root of
all the difficulties and errors into which those who have
sought to establish a universal psychology have fallen.</p>

<p>I must now raise the question&mdash;is a psychology of the
male possible as a science? The answer must be that it is
not possible. I must be understood to reject all the investigations
of the experimenters, and those who are still sick
with the experimental fever may ask in wonder if all these
have no value? Experimental psychology has not given a<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
single explanation as to the deeper laws of masculine life;
it can be regarded only as a series of sporadic empirical
efforts, and its method is wrong inasmuch as it seeks to
reach the kernel of things by surface examination, and as
it cannot possibly give an explanation of the deep-seated
source of all psychical phenomena. When it has attempted
to discover the real nature of psychical phenomena by
measurements of the physical phenomena that accompany
them, it has succeeded in showing that even in the most
favourable cases there is an inconstancy and variation. The
fundamental possibility of reaching the mathematical idea of
knowledge is that the data should be constant. As the mind
itself is the creator of time and space, it is impossible to
expect that geometry and arithmetic should explain the
mind, that the creature should explain the creator.</p>

<p>There can be no scientific psychology of man, for the aim
of psychology is to derive what is not derivative, to prove to
every man what his real nature and essence are, to deduce
these. But the possibility of deducing them would imply
that they were not free. As soon as it has been admitted
that the conduct, action, nature, of an individual man can
be determined scientifically, it will be proved that man has
no free-will. Kant and Schopenhauer understood this fully,
and, on the other hand, Hume and Herbart, the founders of
modern psychology, did not believe in free-will. It is this
dilemma that is the cause of the pitiful relation of modern
psychology to all fundamental questions. The wild and
repeated efforts to derive the will from psychological factors,
from perception and feeling, are in themselves evidence that it
cannot be taken as an empirical factor. The will, like the
power of judgment, is associated inevitably with the existence
of an ego, or soul. It is not a matter of experience, it transcends
experience, and until psychology recognises this extraneous
factor, it will remain no more than a methodical annex
of physiology and biology. If the soul is only a complex
of experiences it cannot be the factor that makes experiences
possible. Modern psychology in reality denies the existence
of the soul, but the soul rejects modern psychology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span></p>

<p>This work has decided in favour of the soul against the
absurd and pitiable psychology without a soul. In fact, it
may be doubted if, on the assumption that the soul exists
and has free thought and free-will, there can be a science
of causal laws and self-imposed rules of willing and thinking.
I have no intention of trying to inaugurate a new era of
rational psychology. I wish to follow Kant in positing the
existence of a soul as the unifying and central conception,
without which any explanation or description of psychic
life, however faithful in its details, however sympathetically
undertaken, must be wholly unsatisfying. It is extraordinary
how inquirers who have made no attempt to analyse such
phenomena as shame and the sense of guilt, faith and hope,
fear and repentance, love and hate, yearning and solitude,
vanity and sensitiveness, ambition and the desire for immortality,
have yet the courage simply to deny the ego because
it does not flaunt itself like the colour of an orange or the
taste of a peach. How can Mach and Hume account for
such a thing as style, if individuality does not exist? Or
again, consider this: no animal is made afraid by seeing its
reflection in a glass, whilst there is no man who could spend
his life in a room surrounded with mirrors. Can this fear,
the fear of the doppelganger,<a id="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> be explained on Darwinian
principles? The word doppelganger has only to be mentioned
to raise a deep dread in the mind of any man. Empirical
psychology cannot explain this; it reaches the depths.
It cannot be explained, as Mach would explain the fear of
little children, as an inheritance from some primitive, less
secure stage of society. I have taken this example only to
remind the empirical psychologists that there are many
things inexplicable on their hypotheses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote14"><a href="#FNanchor14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
It is notable that women are devoid of this fear; female doppelgangers
are not heard of.</p>

<p>Why is any man annoyed when he is described as a
Wagnerite, a Nietzchite, a Herbartian, or so forth? He
objects to be thought a mere echo. Even Ernst Mach is
angry in anticipation at the thought that some friend will<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
describe him as a Positivist, Idealist, or any other non-individual
term. This feeling must not be confused with
the results of the fact that a man may describe himself as a
Wagnerite, and so forth. The latter is simply a deep approval
of Wagnerism, because the approver is himself a
Wagnerite. The man is conscious that his agreement is in
reality a raising of the value of Wagnerism. And so also a
man will say much about himself that he would not permit
another to say of him. As Cyrano de Bergerac put it:</p>

<p class="noindent">It cannot be right to consider such men as Pascal and
Newton, on the one hand, as men of the highest genius, on
the other, as limited by a mass of prejudices which we of
the present generation have long overcome. Is the present
generation with its electrical railways and empirical psychology
so much higher than these earlier times? Is culture,
if culture has any real value, to be compared with science,
which is always social and never individual, and to be
measured by the number of public libraries and laboratories?
Is culture outside human beings and not always in human
beings?</p>

<p>It is in striking harmony with the ascription to men alone
of an ineffable, inexplicable personality, that in all the
authenticated cases of double or multiple personality the
subjects have been women. The absolute female is capable
of sub-division; the male, even to the most complete characterology
and the most acute experiment, is always an
indivisible unit. The male has a central nucleus of his
being which has no parts, and cannot be divided; the
female is composite, and so can be dissociated and cleft.</p>

<p>And so it is most amusing to hear writers talking of the
soul of the woman, of her heart and its mysteries, of the
psyche of the modern woman. It seems almost as if even
an accoucheur would have to prove his capacity by the
strength of his belief in the soul of women. Most women,
at least, delight to hear discussions on their souls, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
they know, so far as they can be said to <i>know</i> anything, that
the whole thing is a swindle. The woman as the Sphinx!
Never was a more ridiculous, a more audacious fraud perpetrated.
Man is infinitely more mysterious, incomparably
more complicated.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to look at the faces of women one
passes in the streets. There is scarcely one whose expression
could not at once be summed up. The register of
woman&#8217;s feelings and disposition is so terribly poor,
whereas men&#8217;s countenances can scarcely be read after long
and earnest scrutiny.</p>

<p>Finally, I come to the question as to whether there exists
a complete parallelism or a condition of reciprocal interaction
between mind and body. In the case of the female,
psycho-physical parallelism exists in the form of a complete
co-ordination between the mental and the physical; in
women the capacity for mental exertion ceases with senile
involution, just as it developed in connection with and in
subservience to the sexual instincts. The intelligence of
man never grows as old as that of the woman, and it is
only in isolated cases that degeneration of the mind is
linked with degeneration of the body. Least of all does
mental degeneration accompany the bodily weakness of old
age in those who have genius, the highest development of
mental masculinity.</p>

<p>It is only to be expected that the philosophers who most
strongly argued in favour of parallelism, such as Spinoza
and Fechner, were also determinists. In the case of the
male, the free intelligible agent who by his own will can
distinguish between good and evil, the existence of parallelism
between mind and body must be rejected.</p>

<p>The question, then, as to the proper view of the psychology
of the sexes may be taken as settled. There has to
be faced, however, an extraordinarily difficult problem that,
so far as I know, has not even been stated yet, but the
answer to which, none the less, strongly supports my view
of the soullessness of women.</p>

<p>In the earlier pages of my volume I contrasted the clarity<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
of male thinking processes with their vagueness in woman,
and later on showed that the power of orderly speech, in
which logical judgments are expressed, acts on women as a
male sexual character. Whatever is sexually attractive to
the female must be characteristic of the male. Firmness in
a man&#8217;s character makes a sexual impression on a woman,
whilst she is repelled by the pliant man. People often
speak of the moral influence exerted on men by women,
when no more is meant than that women are striving to
attain their sexual complements. Women demand manliness
from men, and feel deeply disappointed and full of
contempt if men fail them in this respect. However untruthful
or great a flirt a woman may be, she is bitterly
indignant if she discover traces of coquetry or untruthfulness
in a man. She may be as cowardly as she likes, but
the man must be brave. It has been almost completely
overlooked that this is only a sexual egotism seeking to
secure the most satisfactory sexual complement. From the
side of empirical observation, no stronger proof of the soullessness
of woman could be drawn than that she demands a
soul in man, that she who is not good in herself demands
goodness from him. The soul is a masculine character,
pleasing to women in the same way and for the same purpose
as a masculine body or a well-trimmed moustache. I
may be accused of stating the case coarsely, but it is none
the less true. It is the man&#8217;s will that in the last resort
influences a woman most powerfully, and she has a strong
faculty for perceiving whether a man&#8217;s &#8220;I will&#8221; means mere
bombast or actual decision. In the latter case the effect on
her is prodigious.</p>

<p>How is it that woman, who is soulless herself, can discern
the soul in man? How can she judge about his morality
who is herself non-moral? How can she grasp his character
when she has no character herself? How appreciate his
will when she is herself without will?</p>

<p>These difficult problems lie before us, and their solutions
must be placed on strong foundations, for there will be
many attempts to destroy them.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER X</span><br />
MOTHERHOOD AND PROSTITUTION</h3>

<p>The chief objection that will be urged against my views is
that they cannot possibly be valid for all women. For
some, or even for the majority, they will be accepted as true,
but for the rest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was not my original intention to deal with the different
kinds of women. Women may be regarded from many
different points of view, and, of course, care must be taken
not to press too hardly what is true for one extreme type.
If the word character be accepted in its common, empirical
signification, then there are differences in women&#8217;s characters.
All the properties of the male character find remarkable
analogies in the female sex (an interesting case
will be dealt with later on in this chapter); but in the male
the character is always deeply rooted in the sphere of the
intelligible, from which there has come about the lamentable
confusion between the doctrine of the soul and characterology.
The characterological differences amongst women
are not rooted so deeply that they can develop into individuality;
and probably there is no female quality that in
the course of the life of a woman cannot be modified,
repressed, or annihilated by the will of a man.</p>

<p>How far such differences in character may exist in cases
that have the same degree of masculinity or of femininity I
have not yet been at the pains to inquire. I have refrained
deliberately from this task, because in my desire to prepare
the way for a true orientation of all the difficult problems
connected with my subject I have been anxious not to raise
side issues or to burden the argument with collateral details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span></p>

<p>The detailed characterology of women must wait for a
detailed treatment, but even this work has not totally
neglected the differences that exist amongst women; I shall
hope to be acquitted of false generalisations if it be remembered
that what I have been saying relates to the female
element, and is true in the same proportion that women
possess that element. However, as it is quite certain that a
particular type of woman will be brought forward in opposition
to my conclusions, it is necessary to consider carefully
that type and its contrasting type.</p>

<p>To all the bad and defamatory things that I have said
about women, the conception of woman as a mother will
certainly be opposed. But those who adduce this argument
will admit the justice of a simultaneous consideration
of the type that is at the opposite pole from motherhood, as
only in this way is it possible to define clearly in what
motherhood consists and to delimit it from other types.</p>

<p>The type standing at the pole opposite to motherhood is
the prostitute. The contrast is not any more inevitable than
the contrast between man and woman, and certain limits
and restrictions will have to be made. But allowing for
these, women will now be treated as falling into two types,
sometimes having in them more of the one type, sometimes
more of the other.</p>

<p>This dichotomy may be misunderstood if I do not distinguish
it from a contrast that is popularly made. It is often
said that a woman should be both mother and mistress. I
do not see the sense or the utility of the distinction involved
in the phrase. Is no more meant by &#8220;mistress&#8221; than the
condition which of necessity must precede motherhood?
If that is so, then no lasting characterological property is
involved. For the word &#8220;mistress&#8221; tells us nothing about
a woman except that she is in a certain relation to a man.
It has nothing to do with her real being; it is something
imposed on her from without. The conception of being
loved tells us nothing about the nature of the person who is
loved. The condition of being loved, whether as mother or
mistress, is a merely accidental, external designation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
individual, whereas the quality of motherhood is something
born in a woman, something deep-seated in her nature. It
is this something that we must investigate.</p>

<p>That motherhood and prostitution are at extreme poles
appears probable simply from the fact that motherly women
bear far more children, whilst the frivolous have few children,
and prostitutes are practically sterile. It must be
remembered, of course, that it is not only prostitutes who
belong to the prostitute type; very many so-called respectable
girls and married women belong to it. Accurate
analysis of the type will show that it reaches far beyond the
mere women of the streets. The street-walker differs from
the respectable coquette and the celebrated hetaira only
through her incapacity for differentiation, her complete
want of memory, and her habit of living from moment to
moment. If there were but one man and one woman on
the earth, the prostitute type would reveal itself in the relations
of the woman to the man.</p>

<p>This fact of limited fertility ought by itself to relieve me
from the necessity of comparing my view of prostitution
with the popular view that would derive what is really deep-seated
in the nature of women from mere social conditions,
from the poverty of women and the economic stress of a
society arranged by males, from the difficulty of women
succeeding in a respectable career, or from the existence of
a large bachelor class with the consequent demand for a
system of prostitution. To these suggestions it may well
be replied that prostitution is by no means confined to the
poorer classes; that women without any economic necessity
have frequently given way to its appeal; that there are
many situations in shops, offices, post-offices, the telegraph
and telephone services, wherever mere mechanical ability is
required, where women are preferred because, from their
lower degree of differentiation, their demands are smaller;
and business men having discovered this in anticipation of
science, readily employ them at a lower rate of wages.
Young prostitutes have often quite as hard an economic
battle to fight, as they must wear expensive clothes, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
they are always charged excessively high rates for food and
lodging. Prostitution is not a result of social conditions,
but of some cause deep in the nature of women; prostitutes
who have been &#8220;reclaimed&#8221; frequently, even if provided
for, return to their old way of life. It is a curious circumstance
that prostitutes appear to be relatively immune to
certain diseases which readily affect other types of women.
I may note finally, that prostitution is not a modern growth;
it has been known from the earliest times, and even was a
part of some ancient religions, as, for instance, among the
Ph&#339;nicians.</p>

<p>Prostitution cannot be considered as a state into which
men have seduced women. The man may occasionally be
to blame, as, for instance, when a servant is discharged and
finds herself deserted. But where there is no inclination
for a certain course, the course will not be adopted. Prostitution
is foreign to the male element, although the lives of
men are often more laborious and unpleasant than those of
women, and male prostitutes (such as are found amongst
waiters, barbers, and so on) are always advanced sexually
intermediate forms. The disposition for and inclination to
prostitution is as organic in a woman as is the capacity for
motherhood.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not mean to suggest that, when any
woman becomes a prostitute, it is because of an irresistible,
inborn craving. Probably most women have both possibilities
in them, the mother and the prostitute. What is to
happen in cases of doubt depends on the man who is able to
make the woman a mother, not merely by the physical act
but by a single look at her. Schopenhauer said that a
man&#8217;s existence dates from the moment when his father and
mother fell in love. That is not true. The birth of a
human being, ideally considered, dates from the moment
when the mother first saw or heard the voice of the father of
her child. Biological and medical science, under the
influence of Johannes M&uuml;ller, Th. Bischoff, and Darwin have
been completely opposed, for the last sixty years, to the
theory of &#8220;impression.&#8221; I may later attempt to develop<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
such a theory. For the present I shall remark only that it
is not fatal to the theory of impression that it does not agree
with the view which regards the union of an ovum and
spermatazoon as the only beginning of a new individual;
and science will have to deal with it instead of regarding it
as being opposed to all experience and so rejecting it. In
an <i>a priori</i> science such as mathematics, I may take it for
granted that even on the planet Jupiter 2 and 2 could not
make 5, but biology deals only with propositions of relative
universality. Although I support the theory of the existence
of such a power of impression, it must not be supposed that I
think that all malformations and abnormalities, or even any
large number of them, are due to it. I go no further than
to say that it is possible for the progeny to be influenced by
a man, although physical relations between him and the
mother have not taken place. And just as Schopenhauer
and Goethe were correct in their theory of colour, although
they were in opposition to all the physicists of the past,
present, and future, so Ibsen (in &#8220;The Lady from the Sea&#8221;)
and Goethe (in &#8220;Elective Affinities&#8221;) may be right against
all the scientific men who deal with the problems of inheritance
on a purely physical basis.</p>

<p>If a man has an influence on a woman so great that her
children of whom he is not the father resemble him, he
must be the absolute sexual complement of the woman in
question. If such cases are very rare, it is only because
there is not much chance of the absolute sexual complements
meeting, and this is no argument against the
truth of the views of Goethe and Ibsen to which I have just
referred.</p>

<p>It is a rare chance if a woman meets a man so completely
her sexual complement that his mere presence makes him
the father of her children. And so it is conceivable in the
case of many mothers and prostitutes that their fates have
been reversed by accident. On the other hand, there must
be many cases in which the woman remains true to the
maternal type without meeting the necessary man, and also
cases where a woman, even although she meets the man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
may be driven none the less into the prostitute type by her
natural instincts.</p>

<p>We have not to face the general occurrence of women as
one or other of two distinct inborn types, the maternal
type and the prostitute. The reality is found between the
two. There are certainly no women absolutely devoid of
the prostitute instinct to covet being sexually excited by
any stranger. And there are equally certainly no women
absolutely devoid of all maternal instincts, although I confess
that I have found more cases approaching the absolute
prostitute than the absolute mother.</p>

<p>The essence of motherhood consists, as the most superficial
investigation will reveal, in that the getting of the child
is the chief object of life, whereas in the prostitute sexual
relations in themselves are the end. The investigation of
the subject must be pursued by considering the relation of
each type to the child and to sexual congress.</p>

<p>Consider the relation to the child first. The absolute
prostitute thinks only of the man; the absolute mother
thinks only of the child. The best test case is the relation
to the daughter. It is only when there is no jealousy about
her youth or greater beauty, no grudging about the admiration
she wins, but an identification of herself with her
daughter so complete that she is as pleased about her
child&#8217;s admirers as if they were her own, that a woman has
a claim to the title of perfect mother.</p>

<p>The absolute mother (if such existed), who thinks only
about the child, would become a mother by any man. It
will be found that women who were devoted to dolls when
they were children, and were kind and attentive to children
in their own childhood, are least particular about their
husbands, and are most ready to accept the first good match
who takes any notice of them and who satisfies their
parents and relatives. When such a maiden has become a
mother, it matters not by whom, she ceases to pay any
attention to any other men. The absolute prostitute, on
the other hand, even when she is still a child, dislikes
children; later on, she may pretend to care for them as<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
a means of attracting men through the idea of mother
and child. She is the woman whose desire is to please
all men; and since there is no such thing as an ideally
perfect type of mother, there are traces of this desire to
please in every woman, as every man of the world will
admit.</p>

<p>Here we can trace at least a formal resemblance between
the two types. Both are careless as to the individuality of
their sexual complement. The one accepts any possible
man who can make her a mother, and once that has been
achieved asks nothing more; on this ground only is she to
be described as monogamous. The other is ready to yield
herself to any man who stimulates her erotic desires; that
is her only object. From this description of the two
extreme types we may hope to gain some knowledge of the
nature of actual women.</p>

<p>I have to admit that the popular opinion as to the monogamous
nature of women as opposed to the essential
polygamy of the male, an opinion I long held, is erroneous.
The contrary is the case. One must not be misled by the
fact that a woman will wait very long for a particular man,
and where possible will choose him who can bestow most
value on her, the most noble, the most famous, the ideal
prince. Woman is distinguished by this desire for value
from the animals, who have no regard for value either for
themselves and through themselves, as in the case of a man,
or for another and through another, as in the case of a
woman. But this could be brought forward only by fools
as in any way to the credit of woman, since, indeed, it shows
most strongly that she is devoid of a feeling of personal
value. The desire for this demands to be satisfied, but does
not find satisfaction in the moral idea of monogamy. The
man is able to pour forth value, to confer it on the woman;
he can give it, he wishes to give it, but he cannot receive it.
The woman seeks to create as much personal value as possible
for herself, and so adheres to the man who can
give her most of it; faithfulness of the man, however, rests
on other grounds. He regards it as the completion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span>
ideal love, as a fulfilment, even although it is questionable
if that could be attained. His faithfulness springs from
the purely masculine conception of truth, the continuity
demanded by the intelligible ego. One often hears it said
that women are more faithful than men; but man&#8217;s faithfulness
is a coercion which he exercises on himself, of his own
free will, and with full consciousness. He may not adhere
to this self-imposed contract, but his falling away from it
will seem as a wrong to himself. When he breaks his faith
he has suppressed the promptings of his real nature. For
the woman unfaithfulness is an exciting game, in which the
thought of morality plays no part, but which is controlled
only by the desire for safety and reputation. There is no
wife who has not been untrue to her husband in thought,
and yet no woman reproaches herself with this. For a
woman pledges her faith lightly and without any full consciousness
of what she does, and breaks it just as lightly and
thoughtlessly as she pledged it. The motive for honouring
a pledge can be found only in man; for a woman does not
understand the binding force of a given word. The
examples of female faithfulness that can be adduced
against this are of little value. They are either the slow
result of the habit of sexual acquiescence, or a condition
of actual slavery, dog-like, attentive, full of instinctive
tenacious attachment, comparable with that necessity for
actual contact which marks female sympathy.</p>

<p>The conception of faithfulness to one has been created
by man. It arises from the masculine idea of individuality
which remains unchanged by time, and, therefore, needs as
its complement always one and the same person. The
conception of faithfulness to one person is a lofty one, and
finds a worthy expression in the sacramental marriage of
the Catholic Church. I am not going to discuss the question
of marriage or free-love. Marriage in its existing form is
as incompatible as free-love with the highest interpretations
of the moral law. And so divorce came into the world
with marriage.</p>

<p>None the less marriage could have been invented only by<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
man. No proprietary institution originated with women.
The introduction of order into chaotic sexual relations
could have come only through man&#8217;s desire for it, and his
power to establish it. There have been periods in the
history of many primitive races in which women had great
influence; but the period of matriarchy was a period of
polyandry.</p>

<p>The dissimilarity in the relations of mother and prostitute
to their child is rich in important conclusions. A woman
in whom the prostitute element is strong will perceive her
son&#8217;s manhood and always stand in a sexual relation to him.
But as no woman is the perfect type of mother, there is
something sexual in the relation of every mother and son.
For this reason, I chose the relation of the mother to her
daughter and not to her son, as the best measure of her
type. There are many well-known physiological parallels
between the relations of a mother to her children and of a
wife to her husband.</p>

<p>Motherliness, like sexuality, is not an individual relation.
When a woman is motherly the quality will be exercised
not only on the child of her own body, but towards all men,
although later on her interest in her own child may become
all-absorbing and make her narrow, blind, and unjust in
the event of a quarrel.</p>

<p>The relation of a motherly girl to her lover is interesting.
Such a girl is inclined to be motherly towards the man
she loves, especially towards that man who will afterwards
become the father of her child; in fact, in a certain sense
the man is her child. The deepest nature of the mother-type
reveals itself in this identity of the mother and loving
wife; the mothers form the enduring root-stock of our race
from which the individual man arises, and in the face of
which he recognises his own impermanence. It is this idea
which enables the man to see in the mother, even while
she is still a girl, something eternal, and which gives the
pregnant woman a tremendous significance. The enduring
security of the race lies in the mystery of this figure, in the
presence of which man feels his own fleeting impermanence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
In such minutes there may come to him a sense of freedom
and peace, and in the mysterious silence of the idea, he
may think that it is through the woman that he is in true
relation with the universe. He becomes the child of his
beloved one, a child whose mother smiles on him, understands
him, and takes care of him (Siegfried and Br&uuml;nnhilde,
Act III.). But this does not last long. (Siegfried
tears himself from Br&uuml;nnhilde). For a man only comes to
his fulness when he frees himself from the race, when he
raises himself above it. For paternity cannot satisfy the
deepest longings of a man, and the idea that he is to be lost
in the race is repellent to him. The most terrible chapter
in the most comfortless of all the great books that have
been written, the chapter on &#8220;Death and its Relation to
the Indestructibility of our Nature,&#8221; in Schopenhauer&#8217;s
&#8220;The World as Will and Idea,&#8221; is where the permanence of
the will to maintain the species is set down as the only real
permanence.</p>

<p>It is the permanence of the race that gives the mother
her courage and fearlessness in contrast with the cowardliness
and fear of the prostitute. It is not the courage of
individuality, the moral courage arising from an inner sense
of freedom and personal value, but rather the desire that
the race should be maintained which, acting through the
mother, protects the husband and child. As courage and
cowardice belong respectively to the mother and the
prostitute, so is it with that other pair of contrasting ideas,
hope and fear. The absolute mother stands in a persisting
relation to hope; as she lives on through the race, she does
not quail before death, whilst the prostitute has a lasting
fear of it.</p>

<p>The mother feels herself in a sense superior to the man;
she knows herself to be his anchor; as she is in a secure
place, linked in the chain of the generations, she may be
likened to a harbour from which each new individual sails
forth to wander on the high seas. From the moment of
conception onwards the mother is psychically and physically
ready to feed and protect her child. And this protective<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
superiority extends itself to her lover; she understands all
that is simple and na&iuml;ve and childlike in him, whilst the
prostitute understands best his caprices and refinements.
The mother has the craving to teach her child, to give him
everything, even when the child is represented by the lover;
the prostitute strives to impose herself on the man, to
receive everything from him. The mother as the upholder
of the race is friendly to all its members; it is only when
there is an exclusive choice to be made between her child
and others that she becomes hard and relentless; and so
she can be both more full of love and more bitter than
the prostitute.</p>

<p>The mother is in complete relation with the continuity of
the race; the prostitute is completely outside it. The
mother is the sole advocate and priestess of the race. The
will of the race to live is embodied in her, whilst the existence
of the prostitute shows that Schopenhauer was pushing
a generalisation too far when he declared that all sexuality
had relation only to the future generation. That the mother
cares only for the life of her own race is plain from the absence
of consideration for animals shown by the best of mothers.
A good mother, with the greatest peace of mind and content,
will slaughter fowl after fowl for her family. The mother of
children is a cruel step-mother to all other living things.</p>

<p>Another striking aspect of the mother&#8217;s relation to the
preservation of the race reveals itself in the matter of food.
She cannot bear to see food wasted, however little may be
left over; whilst the prostitute wilfully squanders the quantities
of food and drink she demands. The mother is stingy
and mean; the prostitute open-handed and lavish. The
mother&#8217;s object in life is to preserve the race, and her delight
is to see her children eat and to encourage their appetites.
And so she becomes the good housekeeper. Ceres was a
good mother, a fact expressed in her Greek name, Demeter.
The mother takes care of the body, but does not trouble
about the mind.<a id="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
The relation between mother and child<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
remains material from the kissing and hugging of childhood
to the protective care of maturity. All her devotion is for
the success and prosperity of her child in material things.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote15"><a href="#FNanchor15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
Compare the conversation in Ibsen&#8217;s &#8220;Peer Gynt,&#8221; Act ii.,
between the father of Solveig and Aase (perhaps the best-drawn
mother in all literature) when they were discussing the search for
their son:</p>

<p>Aase. &#8220;We shall find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her Husband. &#8220;And save his soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aase. &#8220;And his body.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maternal love, then, cannot be truly represented as resting
on moral grounds. Let any one ask himself if he does
not believe that his mother&#8217;s love would not be just as great
for him if he were a totally different person. The individuality
of the child has no part in the maternal love;
the mere fact of its being her own child is sufficient, and so
the love cannot be regarded as moral. In the love of a
man for a woman, or between persons of the same sex,
there is always some reference to the personal qualities of
the individual; a mother&#8217;s love extends itself indifferently to
anything that she has borne. It destroys the moral conception
if we realise that the love of a mother for her child
remains the same whether the child becomes a saint or a
sinner, a king or a beggar, an angel or a fiend. Precisely
the same conclusion will be reached from reflecting how
children think that they have a claim on their mother&#8217;s love
simply because she is their mother. Maternal love is non-moral
because it has no relation to the individuality of the
being on which it is bestowed, and there can be an ethical
relation only between two individualities. The relation of
mother and child is always a kind of physical reflex. If the
little one suddenly screams or cries when the mother is in
the next room, she will at once rush to it as if she herself
had been hurt; and, as the children grow up, every wish or
trouble of theirs is directly assumed and shared by the
mother as if they were her own. There is an unbreakable
link between the mother and child, physical, like the cord
that united the two before childbirth. This is the real
nature of the maternal relation; and, for my part, I protest<span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span>
against the fashion in which it is praised, its very indiscriminate
character being made a merit. I believe myself
that many great artists have recognised this, but have chosen
to be silent about it. The extraordinary over-praising of
Raphael is losing ground, and the singers of maternal love
are no higher than Fischart or Richepin.</p>

<p>Maternal love is an instinctive and natural impulse, and
animals possess it in a degree as high as that of human
beings. This alone is enough to show that it is not true
love, that it is not of moral origin; for all morality proceeds
from the intelligible character which animals, having no
free will, do not possess. The ethical imperative can be
heard only by a rational creature; there is no such thing as
natural morality, for all morality must be self-conscious.</p>

<p>Her position outside the mere preservation of the race,
the fact that she is not merely the channel and the indifferent
protector of the chain of beings that passes through her,
place the prostitute in a sense above the mother, so far at
least as it is possible to speak of higher or lower from the
ethical point of view when women are being discussed.</p>

<p>The matron whose whole time is taken up in looking after
her husband and children, who is working in, or superintending
the work of, the house, garden, or other forms of
labour, ranks intellectually very low. The most highly-developed
women mentally, those who have been lauded in
poetry, belong to the prostitute category; to these, the
Aspasia-type, must be added the women of the romantic
school, foremost among whom must be placed Karoline
Michaelis-B&ouml;hmer-Forster-Schlegel-Schelling.</p>

<p>It coincides with what has been said that only those men
are sexually attracted by the mother-type who have no desire
for mental productivity. The man whose fatherhood is confined
to the children of his loins is he whom we should
expect to choose the motherly productive woman. Great
men have always preferred women of the prostitute type.<a id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Their choice falls on the sterile woman, and, if there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
issue, it is unfit and soon dies out. Ordinary fatherhood
has as little to do with morality as motherhood. It is
non-moral, as I shall show in chap. xiv.; and it is illogical,
because it deals with illusions. No man ever knows
to what extent he is the father of his own child. And its
duration is short and fleeting; every generation and every
race of human beings soon disappears.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote16"><a href="#FNanchor16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Wherever I am using this term I refer, of course, not merely
to mercenary women of the streets.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The wide-spread and exclusive honouring of the motherly
woman, the type most upheld as the one and only possible
one for women, is accordingly quite unjustified. Although
most men are certain that every woman can have her consummation
only in motherhood, I must confess that the
prostitute&mdash;not as a person, but as a phenomenon&mdash;is much
more estimable in my opinion.</p>

<p>There are various causes of this universal reverence for
the mother.</p>

<p>One of the chief reasons appears to be that the mother
seems to the man nearer his ideal of chastity; but the
woman who desires children is no more chaste than the
man-coveting prostitute.</p>

<p>The man rewards the appearance of higher morality in
the maternal type by raising her morally (although with no
reason) and socially over the prostitute type. The latter
does not submit to any valuations of the man nor to the
ideal of chastity which he seeks for in the woman; secretly,
as the woman of the world, lightly as the demi-mondaine, or
flagrantly as the woman of the streets, she sets herself in
opposition to them. This is the explanation of the social
ostracisms, the practical outlawry which is the present
almost universal fate of the prostitute. The mother readily
submits to the moral impositions of man, simply because
she is interested only in the child and the preservation of
the race.</p>

<p>It is quite different with the prostitute. She lives her
own life exactly as she pleases, even although it may bring
with it the punishment of exclusion from society. She is
not so brave as the mother, it is true, being thoroughly
cowardly; but she has the correlative of cowardice, impudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
and she is not ashamed of her shamelessness. She
is naturally inclined to polygamy, and always ready to
attract more men than the one who would suffice as the
founder of a family. She gives free play to the fulfilment
of her desire, and feels a queen, and her most ardent
wish is for more power. It is easy to grieve or shock the
motherly woman; no one can injure or offend the prostitute;
for the mother has her honour to defend as the
guardian of the species, whilst the prostitute has forsworn
all social respect, and prides herself in her freedom. The
only thought that disturbs her is the possibility of losing
her power. She expects, and cannot think otherwise than
that every man wishes to possess her, that they think of
nothing but her, and live for her. And certainly she
possesses the greatest power over men, the only influence
that has a strong effect on the life of humanity that is not
ordered by the regulations of men.</p>

<p>In this lies the analogy between the prostitute and men
who have been famous in politics. As it is only once in
many centuries that a great conqueror arises, like Napoleon
or Alexander, so it is with the great courtesan; but when she
does appear she marches triumphantly across the world.</p>

<p>There is a relationship between such men and courtesans
(every politician is to a certain extent a tribune of the
people, and that in itself implies a kind of prostitution).
They have the same feeling for power, the same demand to
be in relations with all men, even the humblest. Just as
the great conqueror believes that he confers a favour on
any one to whom he talks, so also with the prostitute.
Observe her as she talks to a policeman, or buys something
in a shop, you see the sense of conferring a favour explicit
in her. And men most readily accept this view that they
are receiving favours from the politician or prostitute (one
may recall how a great genius like Goethe regarded his
meeting with Napoleon at Erfurt; and on the other side we
have the myth of Pandora, and the story of the birth of
Venus).</p>

<p>I may now return to the subject of great men of action<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
which I opened in chap. v. Even so far-seeing a man
as Carlyle has exalted the man of action, as, for instance,
in his chapter on &#8220;The Hero as King.&#8221; I have already
shown that I cannot accept such a view. I may add here
that all great men of action, even the greatest of them, such
as C&aelig;sar, Cromwell, Napoleon, have not hesitated to employ
falsehood; that Alexander the Great did not hesitate
to defend one of his murders by sophistry. But untruthfulness
is incompatible with genius. The &#8220;Memoirs of
Napoleon,&#8221; written at St. Helena, are full of misstatements
and watery sophistry, and his last words, that &#8220;he had
loved only France,&#8221; were an altruistic pose. Napoleon, the
greatest of the conquerors, is a sufficient proof that great
men of action are criminals, and, therefore, not geniuses.
One can understand him by thinking of the tremendous
intensity with which he tried to escape from himself.
There is this element in all the conquerors, great or small.
Just because he had great gifts, greater than those of any
emperor before him, he had greater difficulty in stifling the
disapproving voice within him. The motive of his ambition
was the craving to stifle his better self. A truly great man
may honestly share in the desire for admiration or fame
but personal ambition will not be his aim. He will not try
to knit the whole world to himself by superficial, transitory
bonds, to heap up all the things of the world in a pyramid
over his name. The man of action shares with the epileptic
the desire to be in criminal relation to everything around
him, to make them appanages of his petty self. The great
man feels himself defined and separate from the world, a
monad amongst monads, and, as a true microcosm, he feels
the world already within him; he realises in the fullest sense
of personal experience that he has a definite, assured, intelligible
relation to the world whole. The great tribune and
the great courtesan do not feel that they are marked off
from the world; they merge with it, and demand it all as
decoration or adornment of their empirical persons, and
they are incapable of love, affection, or friendship.</p>

<p>The king of the fairy tale who wished to conquer the<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
stars is the perfect image of the conqueror. The great
genius honours himself, and has not to live in a condition
of give and take with the populace, as is necessary for the
politician. The great politician makes his voice resound in
the world, but he has also to sing in the streets; he may
make the world his chessboard, but he has also to strut in a
booth; he is no more a despot than he is a beggar for alms.
He has to court the populace, and here he joins with the
prostitute. The politician is a man of the streets. He must
be completed by the public. It is the masses that he requires,
not real individualities. If he is not clever he tries
to be rid of the great men, or if, like Napoleon, he is
cunning, he pretends to honour them in order that he may
make them harmless. His dependence on the public makes
some such course necessary. A politician cannot do all
that he wishes, even if he is a Napoleon, and if, unlike
Napoleon, he actually wished to realise ideals, he would
soon be taught better by the public, his real master. The
will of him who covets power is bound.</p>

<p>Every emperor is conscious of this relation between himself
and the masses, and has an almost instinctive love of
great assemblages of his people, or his army, or of his
electors. Not Marcus Aurelius or Diocletian, but Kleo,
Mark Antony, Themistocles, and Mirabeau are the embodiments
of the real politician. Ambition means going
amongst the people. The tribune has to follow the prostitute
in this respect. According to Emerson, Napoleon
used to go <i>incognito</i> amongst the people to excite their
hurrahs and praise. Schiller imagined the same course for
his Wallenstein.</p>

<p>Hitherto the phenomena of the great man of action have
been regarded even by artists and philosophers as unique.
I think that my analysis has shown that there is the strongest
resemblance between them and prostitutes. To see an
analogy between Antonius (C&aelig;sar) and Cleopatra may
appear at first far-fetched, but none the less it exists. The
great man of action has to despise his inner life, in order
that he may live altogether &#8220;in the world,&#8221; and he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
perish, like the things of the world. The prostitute abandons
the lasting purpose of her sex, to live in the instincts of the
moment. The great prostitute and the great tribune are
firebrands causing destruction all around them, leaving
death and devastation in their paths, and pass like meteors
unconnected with the course of human life, indifferent to
its objects, and soon disappearing, whilst the genius and the
mother work for the future in silence. The prostitute and
the tribune may be called the enemies of God; they are
both anti-moral phenomena.</p>

<p>Great men of action, then, must be excluded from the
category of genius. The true genius, whether he be an
artist or a philosopher, is always strongly marked by his
relation to the constructive side of the world.</p>

<p>The motive that actuates the prostitute requires further
investigation. The purpose of the motherly woman was
easy to understand; she is the upholder of the race. But
the fundamental idea of prostitution is much more mysterious,
and no one can have meditated long on the subject
without often doubting if it were possible to get an explanation.
Perhaps the relation of the two types to the sexual
act may assist the inquiry. I hope that no one will consider
such a subject below the dignity of a philosopher. The
spirit in which the inquiry is made is the chief matter. It
is at least clear that the painters of Leda and Dan&auml;e have
pondered over the problem, and many great writers&mdash;I
have in mind Zola&#8217;s &#8220;Confession of Claude,&#8221; his &#8220;Hortense,&#8221;
&#8220;Ren&eacute;e,&#8221; and &#8220;Nana,&#8221; Tolstoi&#8217;s &#8220;Resurrection,&#8221; Ibsen&#8217;s
&#8220;Hedda Gabler,&#8221; and &#8220;Rita,&#8221; and above all the &#8220;Sonja&#8221; of
that great soul Dostoyevski&mdash;must have been thinking of the
general problem rather than merely wishing to describe
particular cases.</p>

<p>The maternal woman regards the sexual relations as
means to an end; the prostitute considers them as the end
itself. That sexual congress may have another purpose
than mere reproduction is plain, as many animals and plants
are devoid of it. On the other hand, in the animal kingdom
sexual congress is always in connection with reproduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
and is never simply lust; and, moreover, takes place only
at times suitable for breeding. Desire is simply the means
employed by nature to secure the continuity of the species.</p>

<p>Although sexual congress is an end in itself for the
prostitute, it must not be assumed that it is meaningless in
the mother-type. Women who are sexually an&aelig;sthetic no
doubt exist in both classes, but they are very rare, and
many apparent cases may really be phenomena of hysteria.</p>

<p>The final importance attached by the prostitute to the
sexual act is made plain by the fact that it is only that type
in which coquetry occurs. Coquetry has invariably a sexual
significance. Its purpose is to picture to the man the
conquest of the woman before it has occurred, in order to
induce him to make the conquest an actual fact. The
readiness of the type to coquet with every man is an expression
of her nature; whether it proceeds further depends on
merely accidental circumstances.</p>

<p>The maternal type regards the sexual act as the beginning
of a series of important events, and so attaches value to it
equally with the prostitute, although in a different fashion.
The one is contented, completed, satisfied; her life is made
richer and of fuller meaning to her by it. The other, for
whom the act is everything, the compression and end of
all life, is never satisfied, never to be satisfied, were she
visited by all the men in the world.</p>

<p>The body of a woman, as I have already shown, is sexual
throughout, and the special sexual acts are only intensifications
of a distributed sensation. Here, also, the difference
between the two types displays itself. The prostitute type
in coquetting is merely using the general sexuality of her
body as an end in itself; for her there is a difference only
in degree between flirtation and sexual congress. The
maternal type is equally sexual, but with a different purpose;
all her life, through all her body, she is being impregnated.
In this fact lies the explanation of the &#8220;impression&#8221; which
I referred to as being indubitable, although it is denied by
men of science and physicians.</p>

<p>Paternity is a diffused relation. Many instances, disputed<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
by men of science, point to an influence not brought about
directly by the reproductive cells. White women who
have borne a child to a black man, are said if they bear
children afterwards to white men, to have retained enough
impression from the first mate to show an effect on the
subsequent children. All such facts, grouped under the
names of &#8220;telegony,&#8221; &#8220;germinal infection,&#8221; and so on,
although disputed by scientists, speak for my view. And
so also the motherly woman, throughout her whole life, is
impressed by lovers, by voices, by words, by inanimate
things. All the influences that come to her she turns to the
purpose of her being, to the shaping of her child, and the
&#8220;actual&#8221; father has to share his paternity with perhaps
other men and many other things.</p>

<p>The woman is impregnated not only through the genital
tract but through every fibre of her being. All life makes
an impression on her and throws its image on her child.
This universality, in the purely physical sphere, is analogous
to genius.</p>

<p>It is quite different with the prostitute. Whilst the
maternal woman turns the whole world, the love of her
lover, and all the impressions that she receives to the purposes
of the child, the prostitute absorbs everything for
herself. But just as she has this absorbing need of the
man, so the man can get something from her which he fails
to find in the badly dressed, tasteless, pre-occupied maternal
type. Something within him requires pleasure, and this he
gets from the daughters of joy. Unlike the mother, these
think of the pleasures of the world, of dancing, of dressing,
of theatres and concerts, of pleasure-resorts. They know
the use of gold, turning it to luxury instead of to comfort,
they flame through the world, making all its ways a
triumphant march for their beautiful bodies.</p>

<p>The prostitute is the great seductress of the world, the
female Don Juan, the being in the woman that knows the
art of love, that cultivates it, teaches it, and enjoys it.</p>

<p>Very deep-seated differences are linked with what I have
been describing. The mother-woman craves for respectability<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
in the man, not because she grasps its value as an
idea, but because it is the supporter of the life of the world.
She herself works, and is not idle like the prostitute; she is
filled with care for the future, and so requires from the man
a corresponding practical responsibility, and will not seduce
him to pleasure. The prostitute, on the other hand, is
most attracted by a careless, idle, dissipated man. A man
that has lost self-restraint repels the mother-woman, is
attractive to the prostitute. There are women who are
dissatisfied with a son that is idle at school; there are others
who encourage him. The diligent boy pleases the mother-woman,
the idle and careless boy wins approval from the
prostitute type. This distinction reaches high up amongst
the respectable classes of society, but a salient example of
it is seen in the fact that the &#8220;bullies&#8221; loved by women of
the streets are usually criminals. The souteneur is always
a criminal, a thief, a fraudulent person, or sometimes even
a murderer.</p>

<p>I am almost on the point of saying that, however little
woman is to be regarded as immoral (she is only non-moral),
prostitution stands in some deep relation with
crime, whilst motherhood is equally bound with the opposite
tendency. We must avoid regarding the prostitute as
the female analogue of the criminal; women, as I have
already pointed out, are not criminals; they are too low in
the moral scale for that designation. None the less, there
is a constant connection between the prostitute type and
crime. The great courtesan is comparable with that great
criminal, the conqueror, and readily enters into actual relations
with him; the petty courtesan entertains the thief and
the pickpocket. The mother type is in fact the guardian of
the life of the world, the prostitute type is its enemy. But
just as the mother is in harmony, not with the soul but with
the body, so the prostitute is no diabolic destroyer of the
idea, but only a corrupter of empirical phenomena. Physical
life and physical death, both of which are in intimate
connection with the sexual act, are displayed by the woman
in her two capacities of mother and prostitute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span></p>

<p>It is still impossible to give a clearer solution than that
which I have attempted, of the real significance of motherhood
and prostitution. I am on an unfamiliar path, almost
untrodden by any earlier wayfarer. Religious myths and
philosophy alike have been unable to propound solutions.
I have found some clues however. The anti-moral significance
of prostitution is in harmony with the fact that it
appears only amongst mankind. In all the animal kingdom
the females are used only for reproduction; there are no
true females that are sterile. There are analogies to prostitution,
however, amongst male animals; one has only to
think of the display and decoration of the peacock, of the
shining glow-worm, of singing birds, of the love dances of
many male birds. These secondary sexual manifestations,
however, are mere advertisements of sexuality.</p>

<p>Prostitution is a human phenomenon; animals and
plants are non-moral; they are never disposed to immorality
and possess only motherhood. Here is a deep secret,
hidden in the nature and origin of mankind. I ought to
correct my earlier exposition by insisting that I have come
to regard the prostitute element as a possibility in all
women just as much as the merely animal capacity for
motherhood. It is something which penetrates the nature
of the human female, something with which the most
animal-like mother is tinged, something which corresponds
in the human female, to the characters that separate the
human male from the animal male. Just as the immoral
possibility of man is something that distinguishes him from
the male animal, so the quality of the prostitute distinguishes
the human female from the animal female. I shall have
something to say as to the general relation of man to this
element in woman, towards the end of my investigation,
but possibly the ultimate origin of prostitution is a deep
mystery into which none can penetrate.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
EROTICS AND &AElig;STHETICS</h3>

<p>The arguments which are in common use to justify a high
opinion of woman have now been examined in all except a
few points to which I shall recur, from the point of view of
critical philosophy, and have been controverted. I hope
that I have justified my deliberate choice of ground,
although, indeed, Schopenhauer&#8217;s fate should have been a
warning to me. His depreciation of women in his philosophical
work &#8220;On Women,&#8221; has been frequently attributed
to the circumstance that a beautiful Venetian girl, in whose
company he was, fell in love with the extremely handsome
personal appearance of Byron; as if a low opinion of
women were not more likely to come to him who had had
the best not the worst fortune with them.</p>

<p>The practice of merely calling any one who assails
woman a misogynist, instead of refuting argument by
argument, has much to commend it. Hatred is never
impartial, and, therefore, to describe a man as having an
animus against the object of his criticism, is at once to lay
him open to the charge of insincerity, immorality, and
partiality, and one that can be made with a hyperbole of
accusation and evasion of the point, which only equal its
lack of justification. This sort of answer never fails in its
object, which is to exempt the vindicator from refuting the
actual statements. It is the oldest and handiest weapon of
the large majority of men, who never wish to see woman
as she is. No men who really think deeply about women
retain a high opinion of them; men either despise women
or they have never thought seriously about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that it is a fallacious method in a
theoretical argument to refer to one&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s psychological
motives instead of bringing forward proofs to
controvert his statements.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to say that in logical controversy
the adversaries should place themselves under an
impersonal conception of truth, and their aim should be to
reach a result, irrespective of their own concrete opinions.
If, however, in an argument, one side has come to a certain
conclusion by a logical chain of reasoning, and the other
side merely opposes the conclusion without having followed
the reasoning process, it is at once fair and appropriate to
examine the psychological motives which have induced the
adversaries to abandon argument for abuse. I shall now
put the champions of women to the test and see how much
of their attitude is due to sentimentality, how much of it is
disinterested, and how much due to selfish motives.</p>

<p>All objections raised against those who despise women
arise from the erotic relations in which man stands to
woman. This relationship is absolutely different from the
purely sexual attraction which occurs in the animal world,
and plays a most important part in human affairs. It is
quite erroneous to say that sexuality and eroticism, sexual
impulse and love, are fundamentally one and the same
thing, the second an embellishing, refining, spiritualising
sublimation of the first; although practically all medical
men hold this view, and even such men as Kant and
Schopenhauer thought so. Before I go into the reasons
for maintaining the existence of this great distinction, I
should like to say something about the views of these two
men.</p>

<p>Kant&#8217;s opinion is not of much weight, because love as
sexual impulse must have been as little known to him as
possible, probably less than in the case of any other man.
He was so little erotic that he never felt the kindred desire
to travel.<a id="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
He represents too lofty and pure a type to speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
with authority on this matter: his one passion was metaphysics.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote17"><a href="#FNanchor17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The association of these two desires may surprise readers. It
rests on a metaphysical ground, much of which will be more
apparent when I have developed my theory of eroticism further.
Time, like space, is conceived of as unlimited, and man, in his desire
for freedom, in his efforts stimulated by his power of free will to
transcend his limits, has the craving for unlimited time and unlimited
space. The desire for travel is simply an expression of this restlessness,
this fundamental chafing of the spirit against its bonds.
But just as eternity is not prolonged time, but the negation of time,
so however far a man wanders, he can extend his area but cannot
abolish space. And so his efforts to transcend space must always
be heroic failures: I shall show that his eroticism is a similar
notable failure.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>As for Schopenhauer, he had just as little idea of the
higher form of eroticism; his sexuality was of the gross
order. This can be seen from the following: Schopenhauer&#8217;s
countenance shows very little kindliness and a
good deal of fierceness (a circumstance which must have
caused him great sorrow. There is no exhibition of ethical
sympathy if one is very sorry for oneself. The most sympathetic
persons are those who, like Kant and Nietzsche,
have no particle of self-pity).</p>

<p>But it may be said with safety that only those who are most
sympathetic are capable of a strong passion: those &#8220;who
take no interest in things&#8221; are incapable of love. This does
not imply that they have diabolical natures. They may, on
the contrary, stand very high morally without knowing
what their neighbours are thinking or doing, and without
having a sense for other than sexual relations with women,
as was the case with Schopenhauer. He was a man who
knew only too well what the sexual impulse was, but he
never was in love; if that were not so, the bias in his famous
work, &#8220;The Metaphysics of Sexual Love,&#8221; would be inexplicable;
in it the most important doctrine is that the unconscious
goal of all love is nothing more than &#8220;the formation
of the next generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>This view, as I hope to prove, is false. It is true that a
love entirely without sexuality has never been known.
However high a man may stand he is still a being with<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
senses. What absolutely disposes of the opposite view is this:
all love, as such&mdash;without going into &aelig;sthetic principles of
love&mdash;is antagonistic to those elements (of the relationship)
which press towards sexual union; in fact, such elements
tend to negate love. Love and desire are two unlike,
mutually exclusive, opposing conditions, and during the
time a man really loves, the thought of physical union with
the object of his love is insupportable. Because there is
no hope which is entirely free from fear does not alter the
fact that hope and fear are utterly opposite principles. It
is just the same in the case of sexual impulse and love.
The more erotic a man is the less he will be troubled with
his sexuality, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>If it be the case that there is no adoration utterly free
from desire, there is no reason why the two should be
identified, since it might be possible for a superior being to
attain the highest phases of both. That person lies, or has
never known what love is, who says he loves a woman
whom he desires; so much difference is there between
sexual impulse and love. This is what makes talk of love
after marriage seem, in most cases, make-believe.</p>

<p>The following will show how obtuse the view of those is
who persist, with unconscious cynicism, in maintaining the
identity of love and sexual impulse. Sexual attraction
increases with physical proximity; love is strongest in the
absence of the loved one; it needs separation, a certain
distance, to preserve it. In fact, what all the travels in the
world could not achieve, what time could not accomplish,
may be brought about by accidental, unintentional, physical
contact with the beloved object, in which the sexual impulse
is awakened, and which suffices to kill love on the
spot. Then, again, in the case of more highly differentiated,
great men, the type of girl desired, and the type of girl
loved but never desired, are always totally different in face,
form, and disposition; they are two different beings.</p>

<p>Then there is the &#8220;platonic love,&#8221; which professors of psychiatry
have such a poor opinion of. I should say rather,
there is only &#8220;platonic&#8221; love, because any other so-called<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
love belongs to the kingdom of the senses: it is the love of
Beatrice, the worship of Madonna; the Babylonian woman
is the symbol of sexual desire.</p>

<p>Kant&#8217;s enumeration of the transcendental ideas of love
would have to be extended if it is to be held. For the
purely spiritual love, the love of Plato and Bruno, which is
absolutely free from desire, is none the less a transcendental
concept; nor is its significance as a concept impaired,
because such a love has never been fully realised.</p>

<p>It is the problem put forward in &#8220;Tannh&auml;user.&#8221; We
have Tannh&auml;user, Wolfram, Venus, and Maria. The fact
that two lovers, who have found each other once for all&mdash;Tristan
and Isolde&mdash;choose death instead of the bridal bed,
is just as absolute a proof of a higher, maybe metaphysical,
something in mankind, as the martyrdom of a Giordano
Bruno.</p>

<p>Who is the object of such love? Is it woman, as she has
been represented in this work, who lacks all higher qualities,
who gets her value from another, who has no power to
attain value on her own account? Impossible. It is the
ideally beautiful, the immaculate woman, who is loved in
such high fashion. The source of this beauty and chastity
in women must now be found.</p>

<p>The question as to whether the female sex is the more
beautiful, and as to whether it deserves the title of &#8220;the&#8221;
beautiful, has been much disputed.</p>

<p>It may be well to consider by whom and how far woman
is considered beautiful.</p>

<p>It is well known that woman is not most beautiful in the
nude. I admit that in pictures or statues the nude female
may look well. But the sexual impulse makes it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
to look at a living woman in a nude condition with the
purely critical, unemotional eye, which is an essential feature
in judging any object of beauty. But apart from this, an
absolute nude female figure in the life leaves an impression
of something wanting, an incompleteness, which is incompatible
with beauty.</p>

<p>A nude woman may be beautiful in details, but the general
effect is not beautiful; she inevitably creates the feeling
that she is looking for something, and this induces disinclination
rather than desire in the spectator. The sight of
an upright female form, in the nude, makes most patent
her purposelessness, the sense of her purpose in life being
derived from something outside herself; in the recumbent
position this feeling is greatly diminished. It is evident
that artists have perceived this in reproducing the nude.</p>

<p>But even in the details of her body a woman is not wholly
beautiful, not even if she is a flawless, perfect type of her
sex. The genitalia are the chief difficulty in the way of
regarding her as theoretically beautiful. If the idea were
justified that man&#8217;s love for woman is the direct result of his
sexual impulse; if we could agree with Schopenhauer that
&#8220;the under-sized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and
short-limbed sex is called beautiful only because the male
intellect is befogged by the sexual impulse, that impulse
being the creator of the conception of the beauty of woman,&#8221;
it would follow that the genitalia could not be excluded from
the conception of beauty. It requires no lengthy exposition
to prove that the genitalia are not regarded as beautiful, and
that, therefore, the beauty of woman cannot be regarded as
due to the sexual impulse. In fact, the sexual impulse is in
reality opposed to the conception of beauty. The man who
is most under its influence has least sense of female beauty,
and desires any woman merely because she is a woman.</p>

<p>A woman&#8217;s nude body is distasteful to man because it
offends his sense of shame. The easy superficiality of our
day has given colour to the statement that the sense of
shame has arisen from the wearing of clothes, and it has
been urged that the objection to the nude arises from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
who are unnatural and secretly immorally-minded. But a
man who has become immorally-minded no longer is
interested in the nude as such, because it has lost its influence
on him. He merely desires and no longer loves.
All true love is modest, like all true pity. There is only
one case of shamelessness&mdash;a declaration of love the
sincerity of which a man is convinced of in the moment
he makes it. This would represent the conceivable maximum
of shamelessness; but there is no declaration of love
which is quite true, and the stupidity of women is shown by
their readiness to believe such protestations.</p>

<p>The love bestowed by the man is the standard of what is
beautiful and what is hateful in woman. The conditions
are quite different in &aelig;sthetics from those in logic or ethics.
In logic there is an abstract truth which is the standard of
thought; in ethics there is an ideal good which furnishes
the criterion of what ought to be done, and the value of the
good is established by the determination to link the will with
the good. In &aelig;sthetics beauty is created by love; there is
no determining law to love what is beautiful, and the beautiful
does not present itself to human beings with any imperative
command to love it. (And so there is no abstract,
no super-individual &#8220;right&#8221; taste).</p>

<p>All beauty is really more a projection, an emanation of the
requirements of love; and so the beauty of woman is not
apart from love, it is not an objective to which love is
directed, but woman&#8217;s beauty is the love of man; they are
not two things, but one and the same thing.</p>

<p>Just as hatefulness comes from hating, so love creates
beauty. This is only another way of expressing the fact
that beauty has as little to do with the sexual impulse as the
sexual impulse has to do with love. Beauty is something
that can neither be felt, touched, nor mixed with other
things; it is only at a distance that it can be plainly discerned,
and when it is approached it withdraws itself. The
sexual impulse which seeks for sexual union with woman is
a denial of such beauty; the woman who has been possessed
and enjoyed, will never again be worshipped for her beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span></p>

<p>I now come to the second question: what are the innocence
and morality of a woman?</p>

<p>It will be convenient to start with a few facts that concern
the origin of all love. Bodily cleanliness, as has often been
remarked, is in men a general indication of morality and
rectitude; or at least it may be said that uncleanly men are
seldom of high character. It may be noticed that when
men, who formerly paid little attention to bodily cleanliness,
begin to strive for a higher perfection of character, they at
the same time take more trouble with the care of the body.
In the same way, when men suddenly become imbued with
passion they experience a simultaneous desire for bodily
cleanliness, and it may almost be said of them that only at
such a time do they wash themselves thoroughly. If we
now turn to gifted men, we shall see that in their case love
frequently begins with self-mortification, humiliation, and
restraint. A moral change sets in, a process of purification
seems to emanate from the object loved, even if her lover
has never spoken to her, or only seen her a few times in the
distance. It is, then, impossible that this process should
have its origin in that person: very often it may be a
bread-and-butter miss, a stolid lump, more often a sensuous
coquette, in whom no one can see the marvellous characteristics
with which his love endows her, save her lover.
Can any one believe that it is a concrete person who is
loved? Does she not in reality serve as the starting point
for incomparably greater emotions than she could inspire?</p>

<p>In love, man is only loving himself. Not his empirical
self, not the weaknesses and vulgarities, not the failings and
smallnesses which he outwardly exhibits; but all that he
wants to be, all that he ought to be, his truest, deepest, intelligible
nature, free from all fetters of necessity, from all
taint of earth.</p>

<p>In his actual physical existence, this being is limited by
space and time and by the shackles of the senses; however
deep he may look into himself, he finds himself damaged
and spotted, and sees nowhere the image of speckless purity
for which he seeks. And yet there is nothing he covets so<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
much as to realise his own ideal, to find his real higher self.
And as he cannot find this true self within himself, he has
to seek it without himself. He projects his ideal of an absolutely
worthy existence, the ideal that he is unable to isolate
within himself, upon another human being, and this act, and
this alone, is none other than love and the significance of love.
Only a person who has done wrong and is conscious of it
can love, and so a child can never love. It is only because
love represents the highest, most unattainable goal of all
longing, because it cannot be realised in experience but
must remain an idea; only because it is localised on some
other human being, and yet remains at a distance, so that
the ideal never attains its realisation; only because of such
conditions can love be associated with the awakening of the
desire for purification, with the reaching after a goal that is
purely spiritual, and so cannot be blemished by physical
union with the beloved person; only thus, is love the
highest and strongest effort of the will towards the supreme
good; only thus does it bring the true being of man to a
state between body and spirit, between the senses and the
moral nature, between God and the beasts. A human being
only finds himself when, in this fashion, he loves. And
thus it comes about that only when they love do many men
realise the existence of their own personality and of the
personality of another, that &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;thou&#8221; become for
them more than grammatical expressions. And so also
comes about the great part played in their love story by the
names of the two lovers. There is no doubt but that it is
through love that many men first come to know of their own
real nature, and to be convinced that they possess a soul.</p>

<p>It is this which makes a lover desire to keep his beloved
at a distance&mdash;on no account to injure her purity by contact
with him&mdash;in order to assure himself of her and of his own
existence. Many an inflexible empiricist, coming under the
influence of love, becomes an enthusiastic mystic; the most
striking example being Auguste Comte, the founder of
positivism, whose whole theories were revolutionised by his
feelings for Clotilde de Vaux.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span></p>

<p>It is not only for the artist, but for the whole of mankind
that <i>Amo, ergo sum</i> holds good psychologically.</p>

<p>Love is a phenomenon of projection just as hate is, not a
phenomenon of equation as friendship is. The latter presupposes
an equality of both individuals: love always
implies inequality, disproportion. To endow an individual
with all that one might be and yet never can be, to make
her ideal&mdash;that is love. Beauty is the symbol of this act
of worship. It is this that so often surprises and angers a
lover when he is convinced that beauty does not imply
morality in a woman. He feels that the nature of the
offence is increased by &#8220;such depravity&#8221; being possible in
conjunction with such &#8220;beauty.&#8221; He is not aware that
the woman in question seems beautiful to him because he
still loves her; otherwise the incongruity between the external
and internal would no longer pain him.</p>

<p>The reason an ordinary prostitute can never seem
beautiful is because it is naturally impossible to endow her
with the projection of value; she can satisfy only the taste
of vulgar minds. She is the mate of the worst sort of men.
In this we have the explanation of a relation utterly opposed
to morality: woman in general is simply indifferent to
ethics, she is non-moral, and, therefore, unlike the anti-moral
criminal, who is instinctively disliked, or the devil
who is hideous in every one&#8217;s imagination, serves as a
receptacle for projected worthiness; as she neither does
good nor evil, she neither resists nor resents this imposition
of the ideal on her personality. It is patent that woman&#8217;s
morality is acquired; but this morality is man&#8217;s, which he
in an access of supreme love and devotion has conveyed
to her.</p>

<p>Since all beauty is always only the constantly renewed
endeavour to embody the highest form of value, there is a
pre-eminently satisfying element in it, in the face of which
all desire, all self-seeking fade away.</p>

<p>All forms of beauty which appeal to man, by reason of
the &aelig;sthetic function, are in reality also attempts on
his part to realise the ideal. Beauty is the symbol of<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
perfection in being. Therefore beauty is inviolable; it is
static and not dynamic; so that any alteration with regard
to it upsets and annuls the idea of it. The desire of
personal worthiness, the love of perfection, materialise in
the idea of beauty. And so the beauty of nature is born, a
beauty that the criminal can never know, as ethics first
create nature. Thus it is that nature always and everywhere,
in its greatest and smallest forms, gives the impression
of perfection. The natural law is only the mortal
symbol of the moral law, as natural beauty is the manifestation
of nobility of the soul; logic thus becomes the
embodiment of ethics! Just as love creates a new woman
for man instead of the real woman, so art, the eroticism of
the All, creates out of chaos the plenitude of forms in the
universe; and just as there is no natural beauty without
form, without a law of nature, so also there is no art without
form, no artistic beauty which does not conform to the
laws of art. Natural beauty is no less a realisation of
artistic beauty than the natural law is the fulfilment of the
moral law, the natural reflection of that harmony whose
image is enthroned in the soul of man. The nature which
the artist regards as his teacher, is the law which he creates
out of his own being.</p>

<p>I return to my own theme from these analyses of art,
which are no more than elaborations of the thoughts of
Kant and Schelling (and of Schiller writing under their
influence). The main proposition for which I have argued
is that man&#8217;s belief in the morality of woman, his projection
of his own soul upon her, and his conception of the woman
as beautiful, are one and the same thing, the second being
the sensuous side of the first.</p>

<p>It is thus intelligible, although an inversion of the truth,
when, in morality, a beautiful soul is spoken of, or when,
following Shaftesbury and Herbart, ethics are subordinated
to &aelig;sthetics; following Socrates and Plato we may identify
the good and the beautiful, but we must not forget that
beauty is only a bodily image in which morality tries to
represent itself, that all &aelig;sthetics are created by ethics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
Every individual and temporal presentation of this
attempted incarnation must necessarily be illusory, and can
have no more than a fictitious reality. And so all individual
cases of beauty are impermanent; the love that is
directed to a woman must perish with the age of the woman.
The idea of beauty is the idea of nature and is permanent,
whilst every beautiful thing, every part of nature, is perishable.
The eternal can realise itself in the limited and the
concrete only by an illusion; it is self-deception to seek the
fulness of love in a woman. As all love that attaches itself
to a person must be impermanent, the love of woman is
doomed to unhappiness. All such love has this source of
failure inherent in it. It is an heroic attempt to seek for
permanent worth where there is no worth. The love that
is attached to enduring worth is attached to the absolute,
to the idea of God, whether that idea be a pantheistic conception
of enduring nature, or remain transcendental; the
love that attaches itself to an individual thing, as to a
woman, must fail.</p>

<p>I have already partly explained why man takes this
burden on himself. Just as hatred is a projection of our
own evil qualities on other persons in order that we may
stand apart from them and hate them; just as the devil
was invented to serve as a vehicle of all the evil impulses in
man; so love has the purpose of helping man in his battle
for good, when he feels that he himself is not strong
enough. Love and hate are alike forms of cowardice. In
hate we picture to ourselves that our own hateful qualities
exist in another, and by so doing we feel ourselves partly
freed from them. In love we project what is good in us,
and so having created a good and an evil image we are
more able to compare and value them.</p>

<p>Lovers seek their own souls in the loved ones, and so
love is free from the limits I described in the first part of
this book, not being bound down by the conditions of
merely sexual attraction. In spite of their real opposition,
there is an analogy between erotics and sexuality. Sexuality
uses the woman as the means to produce pleasure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
children of the body; erotics use her as the means to create
worth and children of the soul. A little understood conception
of Plato is full of the deepest meaning: that love is
not directed towards beauty, but towards the procreation of
beauty; that it seeks to win immortality for the things of
the mind, just as the lower sexual impulse is directed
towards the perpetuation of the species.</p>

<p>It is more than a merely formal analogy, a superficial,
verbal resemblance, to speak of the fruitfulness of the mind,
of its conception and reproduction, or, in the words of
Plato, to speak of the children of the soul. As bodily sexuality
is the effort of an organic being to perpetuate its own
form, so love is the attempt to make permanent one&#8217;s own
soul or individuality. Sexuality and love are alike the
effort to realise oneself, the one by a bodily image, the
other by an image of the soul. But it is only the man of
genius who can approach this entirely unsensuous love, and
it is only he who seeks to produce eternal children in whom
his deepest nature shall live for ever.</p>

<p>The parallel may be carried further. Since Novalis first
called attention to it, many have insisted on the association
between sexual desire and cruelty. All that is born of
woman must die. Reproduction, birth, and death are indissolubly
associated; the thought of untimely death awakens
sexual desire in its fiercest form, as the determination to
reproduce oneself. And so sexual union, considered ethically,
psychologically, and biologically, is allied to murder;
it is the negation of the woman and the man; in its extreme
case it robs them of their consciousness to give life to the
child. The highest form of eroticism, as much as the lowest
form of sexuality, uses the woman not for herself but as
means to an end&mdash;to preserve the individuality of the artist.
The artist has used the woman merely as the screen on
which to project his own idea.</p>

<p>The real psychology of the loved woman is always a
matter of indifference. In the moment when a man loves
a woman, he neither understands her nor wishes to understand
her, although understanding is the only moral basis<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
of association in mankind. A human being cannot love
another that he fully understands, because he would then
necessarily see the imperfections which are an inevitable
part of the human individual, and love can attach itself
only to perfection. Love of a woman is possible only
when it does not consider her real qualities, and so is able
to replace the actual psychical reality by a different and
quite imaginary reality. The attempt to realise one&#8217;s ideal
in a woman, instead of the woman herself, is a necessary
destruction of the empirical personality of the woman. And
so the attempt is cruel to the woman; it is the egoism of
love that disregards the woman, and cares nothing for her
real inner life.</p>

<p>Thus the parallel between sexuality and love is complete.
Love is murder. The sexual impulse destroys the body and
mind of the woman, and the psychical eroticism destroys
her psychical existence. Ordinary sexuality regards the
woman only as a means of gratifying passion or of begetting
children. The higher eroticism is merciless to the woman,
requiring her to be merely the vehicle of a projected personality,
or the mother of psychical children. Love is not
only anti-logical, as it denies the objective truth of the
woman and requires only an illusory image of her, but it
is anti-ethical with regard to her.</p>

<p>I am far from despising the heights to which this
eroticism may reach, as, for instance, in Madonna worship.
Who could blind his eyes to the amazing phenomenon
presented by Dante? It was an extraordinary transference
of his own ideal to the person of a concrete woman whom
the artist had seen only once and when she was a young
girl, and who for all he knew might have grown up into a
Xantippe. The complete neglect of whatever worth the
woman herself might have had, in order that she might
better serve as the vehicle of his projected conception of
worthiness, was never more clearly exhibited. And the
three-fold immorality of this higher eroticism becomes more
plain than ever. It is an unlimited selfishness with regard
to the actual woman, as she is wholly rejected for the ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span>
woman. It is a felony towards the lover himself, inasmuch
as he detaches virtue and worthiness from himself; and it
is a deliberate turning away from the truth, a preferring of
sham to reality.</p>

<p>The last form in which the immorality reveals itself is that
love prevents the worthlessness of woman from being
realised, inasmuch as it always replaced her by an imaginary
projection. Madonna worship itself is fundamentally immoral,
inasmuch as it is a shutting of the eyes to truth.
The Madonna worship of the great artists is a destruction
of woman, and is possible only by a complete neglect of
the women as they exist in experience, a replacement of
actuality by a symbol, a re-creation of woman to serve the
purposes of man, and a murder of woman as she exists.</p>

<p>When a particular man attracts a particular woman the
influence is not his beauty. Only man has an instinct for
beauty, and the ideals of both manly beauty and of womanly
beauty have been created by man, not by woman. The
qualities that appeal to a woman are the signs of developed
sexuality; those that repel her are the qualities of the
higher mind. Woman is essentially a phallus worshipper,
and her worship is permeated with a fear like that of a bird
for a snake, of a man for the fabled Medusa head, as she
feels that the object of her adoration is the power that will
destroy her.</p>

<p>The course of my argument is now apparent. As logic
and ethics have a relation only to man, it was not to be
expected that woman would stand in any better position
with regard to &aelig;sthetics. &AElig;sthetics and logic are closely
interconnected, as is apparent in philosophy, in mathematics,
in artistic work, and in music. I have now shown
the intimate relation of &aelig;sthetics to ethics. As Kant
showed, &aelig;sthetics, just as much as ethics and logic, depend
on the free will of the subject. As the woman has not
free will, she cannot have the faculty of projecting beauty
outside herself.</p>

<p>The foregoing involves the proposition that woman
cannot love. Women have made no ideal of man to<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
correspond with the male conception of the Madonna.
What woman requires from man is not purity, chastity,
morality, but something else. Woman is incapable of
desiring virtue in a man.</p>

<p>It is almost an insoluble riddle that woman, herself
incapable of love, should attract the love of man. It has
seemed to me a possible myth or parable, that in the beginning,
when men became men by some miraculous act of
God, a soul was bestowed only on them. Men, when they
love, are partly conscious of this deep injustice to woman,
and make the fruitless but heroic effort to give her their
own soul. But such a speculation is outside the limits of
either science or philosophy.</p>

<p>I have now shown what woman does not wish; there
remains to show what she does wish, and how this wish is
diametrically opposed to the will of man.</p>

<p class="noindent">The further we go in the analysis of woman&#8217;s claim to
esteem the more we must deny her of what is lofty and
noble, great and beautiful. As this chapter is about to take
the deciding and most extreme step in that direction, I
should like to make a few remarks as to my position. The
last thing I wish to advocate is the Asiatic standpoint with
regard to the treatment of women. Those who have carefully
followed my remarks as to the injustice that all forms
of sexuality and erotics visit on woman will surely see that
this work is not meant to plead for the harem. But it
is quite possible to desire the legal equality of men and
women without believing in their moral and intellectual
equality, just as in condemning to the utmost any harshness
in the male treatment of the female sex, one does not
overlook the tremendous, cosmic, contrast and organic
differences between them. There are no men in whom
there is no trace of the transcendent, who are altogether
bad; and there is no woman of whom that could truly be
said. However degraded a man may be, he is immeasurably
above the most superior woman, so much so that
comparison and classification of the two are impossible;
but even so, no one has any right to denounce or defame
woman, however inferior she must be considered. A
true adjustment of the claims for legal equality can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
undertaken on no other basis than the recognition of a
complete, deep-seated polar opposition of the sexes. I trust
that I may escape confusion of my views as to woman with
the superficial doctrine of P. J. M&ouml;bius&mdash;a doctrine only
interesting as a brave reaction against the general tendency.
Women are not &#8220;physiologically weak-minded,&#8221; and I
cannot share the view that women of conspicuous ability
are to be regarded as morbid specimens.</p>

<p>From a moral point of view one should only be glad to
recognise in these women (who are always more masculine
than the rest) the exact opposite of degeneration, that is to
say, it must be acknowledged that they have made a step
forward and gained a victory over themselves; from the
biological standpoint they are just as little or as much
phenomena of degeneration as are womanish men (unethically
considered). Intermediate sexual forms are normal,
not pathological phenomena, in all classes of organisms,
and their appearance is no proof of physical decadence.</p>

<p>Woman is neither high-minded nor low-minded, strong-minded
nor weak-minded. She is the opposite of all these.
Mind cannot be predicated of her at all; she is mindless.
That, however, does not imply weak-mindedness in the
ordinary sense of the term, the absence of the capacity to
&#8220;get her bearings&#8221; in ordinary everyday life. Cunning,
calculation, &#8220;cleverness,&#8221; are much more usual and constant
in the woman than in the man, if there be a personal
selfish end in view. A woman is never so stupid as a man
can be.</p>

<p>But has woman no meaning at all? Has she no general
purpose in the scheme of the world? Has she not a
destiny; and, in spite of all her senselessness and emptiness,
a significance in the universe?</p>

<p>Has she a mission, or is her existence an accident and
an absurdity?</p>

<p>In order to understand her meaning, it is necessary to
start from a phenomenon which, although old and well
recognised, has never received its proper meed of consideration.
It is from nothing more nor less than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
phenomenon of <i>match-making</i> from which we may be able
to infer most correctly the real nature of woman.</p>

<p>Its analysis shows it to be the force which brings together
and helps forward two people in their knowledge of one
another, which helps them to a sexual union, whether in the
form of marriage or not. This desire to bring about an
understanding between two people is possessed by all women
from their earliest childhood; the very youngest girls are
always ready to act as messengers for their sisters&#8217; lovers.
And if the instinct of match-making can be indulged in only
after the particular woman in question has brought about
her own consummation in marriage, it is none the less
present before that time, and the only things which are at
work against it are her jealousy of her contemporaries, and
her anxiety about their chances with regard to her lover,
until she has finally secured him by reason of her money,
her social position, and so forth.</p>

<p>As soon as women have got rid of their own case by
their own marriage, they hasten to help the sons and
daughters of their acquaintances to marry. The fact that
older women, in whom the desire for sexual satisfaction
has died out, are such match-makers is so fully recognised
that the idea has wrongly spread that they are the
only real match-makers.</p>

<p>They urge not only women but men to marry, a man&#8217;s
own mother often being the most active and persistent
advocate of his marriage. It is the desire and purpose of
every mother to see her son married, without any thought
of his individual taste; a wish which some have been
blind enough to regard as another charm in maternal
love, of which such a poor account was given in an earlier
chapter. It is possible that many mothers may hope that
their sons should obtain permanent happiness through
marriage, however unfit they may be for it; but undoubtedly
this hope is absent with the majority, and in
any case it is the match-making instinct, the sheer objection
to bachelordom, which is the strongest motive of all.</p>

<p>It is clear that women obey a purely instinctive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
inherent impulse, when they try to get their daughters
married.</p>

<p>It is certainly not for logical, and only in a small degree
for material reasons, that they go to such lengths to attain
their ends, and it is certainly not because of any desire expressed
by their daughters (very often it is in direct opposition
to the girl&#8217;s choice); and since the match-making instinct
is not confined to the members of a woman&#8217;s own family,
it is impossible to speak of it as being part of the &#8220;altruistic&#8221;
or &#8220;moral&#8221; attitude of maternal love; although most
women if they were charged with match-making projects
would undoubtedly answer &#8220;that it is their duty to think
of the future welfare of their dear children.&#8221;</p>

<p>A mother makes no difference in arranging a marriage
for her own daughter and for any other girl, and is just as
glad to do it for the latter if it does not interfere with the
interests of her own family; it is the same thing, match-making
throughout, and there is no psychological difference
in making a match for her own daughter and doing the
same thing for a stranger. I would even go so far as to say
that a mother is not inconsolable if a stranger, however
common and undesirable, desires and seduces her daughter.</p>

<p>The attitude of one sex to certain traits of the other can
often be applied as a criterion as to how far certain peculiarities
of character are exclusively the property of the one
sex or are shared by the other. So far, we have had to deny
to women many characters which they would gladly claim,
but which are exclusively masculine; in match-making,
however, we have a characteristic which is really and exclusively
feminine, the exceptions being either in the case
of very womanish men or else special instances which will
be fully dealt with later on, in chap. xiii. Every real man
will have nothing to do with this instinct in his wife, even
when his own daughters, whom he would gladly see settled
in life, are concerned; he dislikes and despises the whole
business, and leaves it entirely to his wife, as being altogether
in her province. This is a striking instance of a purely
feminine psychical characteristic, being not only unattractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
to a man, but even repulsive to him when he is aware of it:
while the male characteristics in themselves are sufficient
to please the female, man has to denude woman of hers
before he can love her.</p>

<p>But the match-making instinct exerts a much deeper and
more important influence on the nature of woman than can
be gathered from the little I have said on this subject. I
wish now to draw attention to woman&#8217;s attitude at a play:
she is always waiting to see if the hero and heroine, the
lovers in the piece, will quarrel. This is nothing but match-making,
and psychologically does not differ a hair from it:
it is the ever present desire to see the man and woman
united. But that is not all; the tremendous excitement
with which women await the crucial point in a decent or
indecent book is due to nothing less than the desire to see
the sexual union of the principal characters, and is coupled
with an actual excitation at the thought, and positive
appreciation of the force which is behind sexual union. It
is not possible to state this formally and logically, the only
thing is to try and understand how it is that the two things
are psychologically one with women. The mother&#8217;s excitement
on her daughter&#8217;s wedding-day is of the same
quality as that engendered by reading a story by Pr&eacute;vost, or
Sudermann&#8217;s &#8220;Katzensteg.&#8221; It is quite true that men are
very interested by novels which end in sexual union, but
in quite a different way from women; they thoroughly
appreciate the sexual act in imagination, but they do not
follow the gradual approach of the two people concerned
from the very beginning; and their interest does not grow,
as woman&#8217;s does, in constant proportion to the reciprocal
value which the two people have for one another.</p>

<p>The breathless pleasure with which the various obstacles
are overcome, the feeling of disappointment at each
thwarting of the sexual purpose, is altogether womanish
and unmanly; but it is always present with woman. She
is continually on the watch for sexual developments, whether
in real life or in literature. Has no one ever wondered
why women are so keen and &#8220;disinterested&#8221; about bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
other men and women together? The satisfaction they
derive from it arises from a personal stimulus at the thought
of the sexual union of others.</p>

<p>But the full extent to which match-making influences the
point of view of all women is not yet fully grasped. On
a summer evening when lovers may be seen in dark
corners of public places, or on the seats and banks round
about, it is always the women who wilfully and curiously
try to see what is happening, whilst men who have to pass
that way do so unwillingly, looking the other way, because
of a sense of intrusion. Just in the same way it is women
who turn in the streets to look at nearly every couple they
meet, and gaze after them. This espionage and turning
round are none the less &#8220;match-making,&#8221; because they are
sub-conscious acts. If a man does not want to see a thing
he turns his back on it, and does not look round; but
women are glad to see two people in love with one another,
and take pleasure in surprising them in their love-making,
because of their innate and super-personal desire that sexual
union should occur.</p>

<p>But man, as was seen much further back, only cares for
that which has a positive value. A woman when she sees
two lovers together is always awaiting developments, that
is to say, she expects, anticipates, hopes, and desires an
outcome. I know an elderly married woman who listened
expectantly at the door for some time, when a servant of
hers had allowed her sweetheart to come into her room,
before she walked in and gave her notice.</p>

<p>The idea of union is always eagerly grasped and never
repelled whatever form it may take (even where animals are
concerned).<a id="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> She experiences no disgust at the nauseating
details of the subject, and makes no attempt to think of
anything pleasanter. This accounts for a great deal of
what is so apparently mysterious in the psychic life of
woman. Her wish for the activity of her own sexual life is
her strongest impulse, but it is only a special case of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
deep, her only vital interest, the interest that sexual unions
shall take place; the wish that as much of it as possible
shall occur, in all cases, places, and times.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote18"><a href="#FNanchor18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The one apparent exception to this rule is fully discussed in
this chapter.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>This universal desire may either be concentrated on the
act itself or on the (possible) child; in the first case, the
woman is of the prostitute type and participates merely for
the sake of the act; in the second, she is of the mother type,
but not merely with the idea of bearing children herself;
she desires that every marriage she knows of or has helped
to bring about should be fruitful, and the nearer she is to
the absolute mother the more conspicuous is this idea; the
real mother is also the real grandmother (even if she remains
a virgin; Johann Tesman&#8217;s marvellous portrayal of &#8220;Tante
Jule&#8221; in Ibsen&#8217;s &#8220;Hedda Gabler&#8221; is an example of what I
mean). Every real mother has the same purpose, that of
helping on matrimony; she is the mother of all mankind;
she welcomes every pregnancy.</p>

<p>The prostitute does not want other women to be with
child, but to be prostitutes like herself.</p>

<p>A woman&#8217;s relations with married men show how she
subordinates her own sexuality to her match-making instinct,
the latter being the dominant power.</p>

<p>Woman objects more strongly to bachelordom than anything
else, because she is altogether a match-maker, and this
makes her try to get men to marry; but if a man is already
married she at once loses most of her interest in him, however
much she liked him before. If the woman herself is
already married, that is to say, when each man she meets is
not a possible solution to her own fate, one would not
imagine that a married man would find less favour with her
because he was married than when he was a bachelor if
the woman herself is unfaithful; but women seldom carry
on an intrigue with another woman&#8217;s husband, except
when they wish to triumph over her by making him neglect
her. This shows that the disposition of woman is towards
the fact of pairing; when men are already paired she
seldom attempts to make them unfaithful, for the fact of their
being paired has satisfied her instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span></p>

<p>This match-making is the most common characteristic of
the human female; the wish to become a mother-in-law is
much more general than even the desire to become a mother,
the intensity and extent of which is usually over-rated.</p>

<p>My readers may possibly not understand the emphasis I
have laid on a phenomenon which is usually looked upon
as amusing as it is disgusting; and it may be thought that
I have given undue importance to it.</p>

<p>But let us see why I have done so. Match-making is
essentially the phenomenon of all others which gives us the
key to the nature of woman, and we must not, as has always
been the case, merely acknowledge the fact and pass on,
but we should try to analyse and explain it. One of our
commonest phrases runs: &#8220;Every woman is a bit of a
match-maker.&#8221;</p>

<p>But we must remember that in this, and nothing else, lies
the actual essence of woman. After mature consideration
of the most varied types of women and with due regard
to the special classes besides those which I have discussed,
I am of opinion that the only positively general
female characteristic is that of match-making, that is, her
uniform willingness to further the idea of sexual union.</p>

<p>Any definition of the nature of woman which goes no
further than to declare that she has the strong instinct for
her own union would be too narrow; any definition that
would link her instincts to the child or to the husband, or
to both, would be too wide. The most general and comprehensive
statement of the nature of woman is that it is
completely adapted and disposed for the special mission of
aiding and abetting the bodily union of the sexes. All
women are match-makers, and this property of the woman
to be the advocate of the idea of pairing is the only one
which is found in women of all ages, in young girls, in
adults, and in the aged. The old woman is no longer
interested in her own union, but she devotes herself to the
pairing of others. This habit of the old woman is nothing
new, it is only the continuance of her enduring instinct
surviving the complications that were caused when her<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
personal interests came into conflict with her general desire;
it is the now unselfish pursuit of the impersonal idea.</p>

<p>It is convenient to recapitulate at this point what my
investigation has shown as to the sexuality of women. I
have shown that woman is engrossed exclusively by
sexuality, not intermittently, but throughout her life; that
her whole being, bodily and mental, is nothing but sexuality
itself. I added, moreover, that she was so constituted
that her whole body and being continually were in sexual
relations with her environment, and that just as the sexual
organs were the centre of woman physically, so the sexual
idea was the centre of her mental nature. The idea of pairing
is the only conception which has positive worth for women.
The woman is the bearer of the thought of the continuity
of the species. The high value which she attaches to the
idea of pairing is not selfish and individual, it is super-individual,
and, if I may be forgiven the desecration of the
phrase, it is the transcendental function of woman. And
just as femaleness is no more than the embodiment of the
idea of pairing, so is it sexuality in the abstract. Pairing is
the supreme good for the woman; she seeks to effect it
always and everywhere. Her personal sexuality is only a
special case of this universal, generalised, impersonal
instinct.</p>

<p>The effort of woman to realise this idea of pairing is so
fundamentally opposed to that conception of innocence
and purity, the higher virginity which man&#8217;s erotic nature
has demanded from women, that not all his erotic incense
would have obscured her real nature but for one factor. I
have now to explain this factor which has veiled from man
the true nature of woman, and which in itself is one of the
deepest problems of woman, I mean her absolute duplicity.
Her pairing instinct and her duplicity, the latter so great as
to conceal even from woman herself what is the real
essence of her nature, must be explained together.</p>

<p>All that may have seemed like clear gain is now again
called into question. Self-observation was found lacking
in women, and yet there certainly are women who observe<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
very closely all that happens to them. They were denied
the love of truth, and yet one knows many women who
would not tell a lie for anything. It has been said that
they are lacking in consciousness of guilt; but there are
many women who reproach themselves bitterly for most
trifling matters, besides &#8220;penitents&#8221; who mortify their
flesh. Modesty was left to man, but what is to be said of
the womanly modesty, that bashfulness, which, according to
Hamerling, only women have? Is there no foundation for
the way in which the idea has grown and found such
acceptance? And then again: Can religion be absent, in
spite of so many &#8220;professing&#8221; women? Are we to exclude
all women from the moral purity, all the womanly virtues,
which poets and historians have ascribed to her? Are we
to say that woman is merely sexual, that sexuality only
receives its proper due from her when it is so well known
that women are shocked at the slightest allusion to sexual
matters, that instead of giving way to it they are often
irritated and disgusted at the idea of impurity, and quite
often detest sexual union for themselves and regard it just
as many men do?</p>

<p>It is, of course, manifest that one and the same point is
bound up in all these antitheses, and on the answer given
to them depends the final and decisive judgment on
woman. And it is clear that if only one single female
creature were really asexual, or could be shown to have a
real relationship to the idea of personal moral worth, everything
that I have said about woman, its general value as
psychically characteristic of the sex, would be irretrievably
demolished, and the whole position which this book has
taken up would be shattered at one blow.</p>

<p>These apparently contradictory phenomena must be
satisfactorily explained, and it must be shown that what is
at the bottom of it all and makes it seem so equivocal arises
from the very nature of woman which I have been trying
to explain all along.</p>

<p>In order to understand these fallacious contradictions
one must first of all remember the tremendous &#8220;accessibility,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
to use another word, the &#8220;impressionability,&#8221; of
women. Their extraordinary aptitude for anything new,
and their easy acceptance of other people&#8217;s views have not
yet been sufficiently emphasised in this book.</p>

<p>As a rule, the woman adapts herself to the man, his
views become hers, his likes and dislikes are shared by
her, every word he says is an incentive to her, and the
stronger his sexual influence on her the more this is so.
Woman does not perceive that this influence which
man has on her causes her to deviate from the line
of her own development; she does not look upon it as a
sort of unwarrantable intrusion; she does not try to shake
off what is really an invasion of her private life; she is not
ashamed of being receptive; on the contrary, she is really
pleased when she can be so, and prefers man to mould her
mentally. She rejoices in being dependent, and her
expectations from man resolve themselves into the moment
when she may be perfectly passive.</p>

<p>But it is not only from her lover (although she would
like that best), but also from her father and mother, uncles
and aunts, brothers and sisters, near relations and distant acquaintances,
that a woman takes what she thinks and believes,
being only too glad to get her opinions &#8220;ready made.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is not only inexperienced girls but even elderly and
married women who copy each other in everything, from
the nice new dress or pretty coiffure down to the places
where they get their things, and the very recipes by which
they cook.</p>

<p>And it never seems to occur to them that they are doing
something derogatory on their part, as it ought to do if
they possessed an individuality of their own and strove to
work out their own salvation. A woman&#8217;s thoughts and
actions have no definite, independent relations to things in
themselves; they are not the result of the reaction of her
individuality to the world. They accept what is imposed
on them gladly, and adhere to it with the greatest firmness.
That is why woman is so intolerant when there has been a
breach of conventional laws. I must quote an amusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
instance, bearing on this side of woman&#8217;s character, from
Herbert Spencer. It is the custom in various tribes of
Indians in North and South America for the men to hunt
and fight and leave all the laborious and menial tasks to
their wives. The Dakotan women are so imbued with the
idea of the reasonableness and fitness of this arrangement
that, instead of feeling injured by it, the greatest insult that
one of these women can offer to another would be implied
in some such words as follows: &#8220;You disgraceful creature....
I saw your husband carrying home wood for the fires.
What was his wife doing that he had to demean himself by
doing woman&#8217;s work?&#8221;</p>

<p>The extraordinary way in which woman can be influenced
by external agencies is similar in its nature to her suggestibility,
which is far greater and more general than man&#8217;s;
they are both in accordance with woman&#8217;s desire to play
the passive and never the active part in the sexual act and
all that leads to it.<a id="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is the universal passivity of woman&#8217;s nature which
makes her accept and assume man&#8217;s valuations of things,
although these are utterly at variance with her nature.
The way in which woman can be impregnated with the
masculine point of view, the saturation of her innermost
thoughts with a foreign element, her false recognition of
morality, which cannot be called hypocrisy because it does
not conceal anything anti-moral, her assumption and practise
of things which in themselves are not in her realm, are
all very well if the woman does not try to use her own
judgment, and they succeed in keeping up the fiction of
her superior morality. Complications first arise when these
acquired valuations come into collision with the only inborn,
genuine, and universally feminine valuation, the supreme
value she sets on pairing.</p>

<p>Woman&#8217;s acceptance of pairing as the supreme good is
quite unconscious on her part. As she has no sense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
individuality she has nothing to contrast with pairing; and
so, unlike man, she cannot realise its significance, or even
notice the presence in herself of this instinct.</p>

<p>No woman knows, or ever has known, or ever will
know, what she does when she enters into association with
man. Femaleness is identical with pairing, and a woman
would have to get outside herself in order to see and understand
that she pairs. Thus it is that the deepest desire of
woman, all that she means, and all that she is, remain
unrecognised by her. There is nothing, then, to prevent
the male negative valuation of pairing overshadowing the
female positive valuation of it in the consciousness of the
woman. The susceptibility of woman is so great that
she can even act in opposition to what she is, to the one
thing on which she really sets a positive value!</p>

<p>But the imposture which she enacts when she allows
herself to be incorporated with man&#8217;s opinions of sexuality
and shamelessness, even of the imposture itself, and when
she uses the masculine standard for her actions, is such a
colossal fraud that she is never conscious of it; she has
acquired a second nature, without even guessing that it is
not her real one; she takes herself seriously, believes she is
something and that she believes in something; she is convinced
of the sincerity and originality of her moralisings and
opinions; the lie is as deeply rooted as that; it is organic. I
cannot do better than speak of the ontological untruthfulness
of woman.</p>

<p>Wolfram indicates clearly enough what is at the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
of woman&#8217;s heart, but he does not say all that is to be said.
Women deceive themselves as well as others on this point.
One cannot artificially suppress and supplant one&#8217;s real
nature, the physical as well as the other side, without something
happening. The hygienic penalty that must be paid
for woman&#8217;s denial of her real nature is hysteria.</p>

<p>Of all the neurotic and psychic phenomena, those of
hysteria are the most fascinating for psychologists; they
represent a far more difficult and, therefore, a more interesting
study than those observed in melancholia or in simple
paranoia.</p>

<p>The majority of psychiatrists have a distrust of psychological
analyses which it is not easy for them to shake off;
every statement of pathological alteration of tissues or
intoxication by certain means is for them <i>a limine</i> credible;
it is only in psychical matters that they refuse to recognise
a primary cause. But since no reason has so far been
given why psychical phenomena should be of importance
secondary to physical phenomena, it is quite justifiable to
disregard such prejudices.</p>

<p>It is quite possible&mdash;there is nothing to prevent it being
so&mdash;that a very great deal, perhaps everything, may depend
on the proper interpretation of the &#8220;psychical mechanism&#8221;
of hysteria. That this is so is proved by the fact that the
few conclusions of any value with reference to hysteria so
far discovered have been arrived at in this way; the investigations
carried out by Pierre Janet, Oskar Vogt, and
particularly by J. Breuer and S. Freud, show what I mean.
All good work on hysteria will undoubtedly follow the lines
these men have worked on; that is to say, by investigation
of the psychological processes which led up to the disease.</p>

<p>I believe myself that what may be called a psychological
sexual traumatism is at the root of hysteria. The
typical picture of a hysterical case is not very different
from the following: A woman has always accepted the
male views on sexual matters; they are in reality totally
foreign to her nature, and sometime, by some chance, out of
the conflict between what her nature asserts to be true and<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
what she has always accepted as true and believed to be
true, there comes what may be called a &#8220;wounding of the
mind.&#8221; It is thus possible for the person affected to declare
a sexual desire to be an &#8220;extraneous body in her consciousness,&#8221;
a sensation which she <i>thinks</i> she detests, but which
in reality has its origin in her own nature. The tremendous
intensity with which she endeavours to suppress the desire
(and which only serves to increase it) so that she may the
more vehemently and indignantly reject the thought&mdash;these
are the alternations which are seen in hysteria. And the
chronic untruthfulness of woman becomes acute if the
woman has ever allowed herself to be imbued with man&#8217;s
ethically negative valuation of sexuality. It is well known
that hysterical women manifest the strongest suggestibility
with men. Hysteria is the organic crisis of the organic
untruthfulness of woman.</p>

<p>I do not deny that there are hysterical men, but these are
comparatively few; and since man&#8217;s psychic possibilities
are endless, that of becoming &#8220;female&#8221; is amongst them,
and, therefore, he can be hysterical. There are undoubtedly
many untruthful men, but in them the crisis takes a different
form, man&#8217;s untruthfulness being of a different kind and
never so hopeless in character as woman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>This examination into the organic untruthfulness of
woman, into her inability to be honest about herself which
alone makes it possible for her to think that she thinks
what is really totally opposed to her nature, appears to me
to offer a satisfactory explanation of those difficulties which
the &aelig;tiology of hysteria present.</p>

<p>Hysteria shows that untruthfulness, however far it may
reach, cannot suppress everything. By education or environment
woman adopts a whole system of ideas and valuations
which are foreign to her, or, rather, has patiently submitted
to have them impressed on her; and it would need a
tremendous shock to get rid of this strongly-rooted psychical
complexity, and to transplant woman to that condition of
intellectual helplessness which is so characteristic of
hysteria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span></p>

<p>An extraordinary shock suffices to destroy the artificial
structure, and to place woman in the arena to undertake a
fight between her unconscious, oppressed nature, and her
certainly conscious but unnatural mind. The see-sawing
which now begins between the two explains the unusual
psychic discontinuity during the hysterical phase, the continual
changes of mood, none of which are subject to the
control of a dominant, central, controlling nucleus of individuality.
It is extraordinary how many contradictions
can co-exist in the hysterical. Sometimes they are highly
intelligent and able to judge correctly and keenly oppose
hypnotism and so forth. Then, again, they are excited by
most trivial causes, and are most subject to hypnotic trances.
Sometimes they are abnormally chaste, at other times
extremely sensual.</p>

<p>All this is no longer difficult to explain. The absolute
sincerity, the painful love of truth, the avoidance of everything
sexual, the careful judgment, and the strength of
will&mdash;all these form part of that spurious personality which
woman in her passivity has taken upon herself to exhibit
to herself and to the world at large. Everything that
belongs to her original temperament and her real sense
form that &#8220;other self,&#8221; that &#8220;unconscious mind&#8221; which can
delight in obscurities and which is so open to suggestion.</p>

<p>It has been endeavoured to show that in what is known
as the &#8220;duplex&#8221; and &#8220;multiplex personality,&#8221; the &#8220;double
conscience,&#8221; the &#8220;dual ego,&#8221; lies one of the strongest
arguments against the belief in the soul. As a matter
of fact, these phenomena are the very reasons why we
ought to believe in a soul. The &#8220;dividing up of the
personality&#8221; is only possible when there never has been
a personality, as with woman. All the celebrated cases
which Janet has described in his book, &#8220;L&#8217;Automatisme
Psychologique,&#8221; concern women, not in a single instance
man. It is only woman who, minus soul or an intelligible
ego, has not the power to become conscious of what is in
her; who cannot throw the light of truth on her inmost
self; who can by her completely passive inundation by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
consciousness belonging to another, allow what is in her
own nature to be suppressed by an extraneous element;
who can display the hysterical phenomena described by
Janet. Hysteria is the bankruptcy of this superficial sham
self which has been put on, and the woman becomes for
the time being a <i>tabula rasa</i>, whilst the working in her of
her own genuine nature appears to her as something coming
from without. This apparent &#8220;secondary personality,&#8221; this
&#8220;foreign body in the consciousness,&#8221; this false self, is, in
reality, the true female nature, sexuality itself appearing,
and a proper understanding of this fact, and of the complications
that must ensue from the ebbings and flowings of
the false, supposed to be true, and the true supposed to be
false, lie at the root of the most difficult phenomena of
hysteria.</p>

<p>Woman&#8217;s incapacity for truth&mdash;which I hold to be consequent
on her lack of free will with regard to the truth, in
accordance with Kant&#8217;s &#8220;Indeterminism&#8221;&mdash;conditions her
falsity. Any one who has had anything to do with women
knows how often they give offhand quite patently untrue
reasons for what they have said or done, under the momentary
necessity of answering a question. It is, however,
hysterical subjects who are most careful to avoid unveracity
(in a most marked and premeditated way before strangers);
but however paradoxical it may sound it is exactly in this
that their untruthfulness lies! They do not know that this
desire for truth has come to them from outside and is no
part of their real nature.</p>

<p>They have slavishly accepted the postulate of morality,
and, therefore, wish to show at every opportunity, like a good
servant, how faithfully they follow instructions.</p>

<p>It is always suspicious when a man is frequently spoken
of as exceptionally trustworthy: he must have gone out of
his way to let people know it, and it would be safe to wager
that in reality he is a rogue. No confidence must be placed
in the genuineness of hysterical morality, which doctors (no
doubt in good faith) often emphasise by remarks as to
the high moral position of their patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span></p>

<p>I repeat: hysterical patients do not consciously simulate.
It can only be made clear to them by suggestion that they
actually have been simulating, and all the &#8220;confessions&#8221; of
the dissimulation can only be explained in the same way.
Otherwise they believe in their own natural honesty and
morality. Neither are the various things which torture
them imaginary; it is much more likely that in the fact
that they feel them, and that the symptoms first disappear
with what Breuer calls &#8220;catharsis&#8221; (the successive bringing
to their consciousness of the true causes of their illness by
hypnotism), lies the proof of their organic untruthfulness.</p>

<p>The self-accusations which hysterical people are so full
of are nothing but unconscious dissimulation. The sense
of guilt, which is equally poignant in great and most
trifling things, cannot be genuine; if the hysterical self-torturers
possessed a standard of morality for themselves
and others they would not be so indiscriminate in their
self-accusations, and not cast as much blame on themselves
for a slight error as for real wrong-doing.</p>

<p>The most distinguishing character of the unconscious untruthfulness
of their self-reproaches is their habit of telling
others how wicked they are, what terrible things they have
done, and then they ask if they (the hysterical) are not hopelessly
abandoned sort of people. No one who really feels
remorse could talk in such a way. The fallacy of representing
the hysterical as being eminently moral is one which
even Breuer and Freud have shared. The hysterical simply
become imbued with moral ideas which are foreign to them
in their normal state. They subordinate themselves to this
code, they cease to prove things for themselves, they no
longer exercise their own judgment.</p>

<p>Probably these hysterical subjects approach more closely
than any other natures to the moral ideal of the social and
utilitarian ethics which regard a lie as moral if it is for the
good of society or of the race. Hysterical women realise
that ideal ontogenetically inasmuch as their standard of
morality comes from without, not from within, and practically
as they appear to act most readily from altruistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
motives. For them duty towards others is not merely
a special application of duty towards oneself.</p>

<p>The untruthfulness of the hysterical is proportional to
their belief in their own accuracy. From their complete
inability to attain personal truth, to be honest about themselves&mdash;the
hysterical never think for themselves, they want
other people to think about them, they want to arouse the
interest of others&mdash;it follows that the hysterical are the
best mediums for hypnotic purposes. But any one who
allows him or herself to be hypnotised is doing the most
immoral thing possible. It is yielding to complete slavery;
it is a renunciation of the will and consciousness; it means
allowing another person to do what he likes with the subject.
Hypnosis shows how all possibility of truth depends
upon the wish to be truthful, but it must be the real wish of
the person concerned: when a hypnotised person is told to
do something, he does it when he comes out of the trance,
and if asked his reasons will give a plausible motive on the
spot, not only before others, but he will justify his action
to himself by quite fanciful reasons. In this we have, so to
speak, an experimental proof of Kant&#8217;s &#8220;Ethical Code.&#8221;</p>

<p>All women can be hypnotised and like being hypnotised,
but this proclivity is exaggerated in hysterical women.
Even the memory of definite events in their life can be
destroyed by the mere suggestion of the hypnotiser.
Breuer&#8217;s experiments on hypnotised patients show clearly
that the consciousness of guilt in them is not deeply seated,
as otherwise it could not be got rid of at the mere suggestion
of the hypnotiser. But the sham conviction of
responsibility, so readily exhibited by women of hysterical
constitution, rapidly disappears at the moment when nature,
the sexual impulse, appears to drive through the superficial
restraints. In the hysterical paroxysm what happens is that
the woman, while no longer believing it altogether herself,
asseverates more and more loudly: &#8220;I do not want
that at all, some one not really me is forcing it on me, but
I do not want it at all.&#8221; Every stimulation from outside
will now be brought into relation with that demand, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
as she partly believes, is being forced on her, but which, in
reality, corresponds with the deepest wish of her nature.
That is why women in a hysterical attack are so easily
seduced. The &#8220;attitudes passionelles&#8221; of the hysterical
are merely passionate repudiations of sexual desire, which are
loud merely because they are not real, and are more plaintive
than at other times because the danger is greater. It is
easy to understand why the sexual experiences of the time
preceding puberty play so large a part in acute hysteria.
The influence of extraneous moral views can be imposed
comparatively easily on the child, as they have little to
overcome in the almost unawakened state of the sexual inclinations.
But, later on, the suppressed, although not wholly
vanquished, nature lays hold of these old experiences, reinterprets
them in the light of the new contents of consciousness,
and the crisis takes place. The different forms that
the paroxysms assume and their shifting nature are due very
largely to the fact that the subject does not admit the true
cause, the presence of a sexual desire, any consciousness of
it being attributed by her to some extraneous influence,
some self that is not her &#8220;real self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Medical observation or interpretation of hysteria is wrong;
it allows itself to be deceived by the patients, who in turn
deceive themselves. It is not the rejecting ego but the
rejected which is the true and original nature of the hysterical
patients, however much they pretend to themselves and
others that it is foreign to them.</p>

<p>If the rejecting ego were really their natural ego they
could act in opposition to the disturbing element which
they say is foreign to them, and be fully conscious of it, and
differentiate and recognise it in their memory. But the
fraud is evident, because the rejecting ego is only borrowed,
and they lack the courage to look their own desire in the
face, although something seems to say that it is the real,
inborn, and only powerful one they have. Even the desire
itself has no real identity, for it is not seated in a real individual,
and, as it is suppressed, leaps, so to speak, from one
part of the body to the other. It may be that my attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
at an explanation will be thought fanciful, but at least it
appears to be true that the various forms of hysteria are
one and the same thing. This one thing is what the
hysterical patient will not admit is part of her, although it
is what is pressing on her. If she were able to ascribe it to
herself and criticise it in the way in which she admits trivial
matters of another kind, she would be in a measure outside
and above her own experiences. The frantic rage of hysterical
women at what they say is imposed on them by some
strange will, whilst it in reality is their own will, shows that
they are just as much under the domination of sexuality as are
non-hysterical women, are just as subject to their destiny
and incapable of averting it, since they, too, are without
any intelligible, free ego.</p>

<p>But it may be asked, with reason, why all women are not
hysterical, since all women are liars? This brings us to a
necessary inquiry as to the hysterical constitution. If my
theory has been on the right lines, it ought to be able to
give an answer in accordance with facts. According to it,
the hysterical woman is one who has passively accepted in
entirety the masculine and conventional valuations instead
of allowing her own mental character its proper play. The
woman who is not to be led is the antithesis of the hysterical
woman. I must not delay over this point; it really belongs
to special female characterology. The hysterical woman is
hysterical because she is servile; mentally she is identical
with the maid-servant. Her opposite (who does not really
exist) is the shrewish dame. So that women may be subdivided
into the maid who serves, and the woman who
commands.<a id="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote20"><a href="#FNanchor20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> We may find the analogy to this in men: there are masculine
&#8220;servants&#8221; who are so by nature, and there is the masculine
form of the shrew&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, the policeman. It is a noticeable
fact that a policeman usually finds his sexual complement in the
housemaid.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The servant is born and not made, and there are many
women in good circumstances who are &#8220;born servants,&#8221;
although they never need to put their rightful position to<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
the test! The servant and the mistress are a sort of &#8220;complete
woman&#8221; when considered as a &#8220;whole.&#8221;<a id="FNanchor21"></a><a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote21"><a href="#FNanchor21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> A real dame would never dream of asking her husband what
she was to do, what she is to give him for dinner, &amp;c.; the hysterical
woman, on the contrary, is always lacking in ideas, and wants
suggestions from others. This is a rough way of indicating the
two types.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The consequences of this theory are fully borne out by
experience. The Xanthippe is the woman who has the
least resemblance to the hysterical type. She vents her
spleen (which is really the outcome of unsatisfied sexual
desires) on others, whereas the hysterical woman visits
hers on herself. The &#8220;shrew&#8221; detests other women, the
&#8220;servant&#8221; detests herself. The drudge weeps out her woes
alone, without really feeling lonely&mdash;loneliness is identical
with morality, and a condition which implies true duality or
manifoldness; the shrew hates to be alone because she
must have some one to scold, whilst hysterical women vent
their passion on themselves. The shrew lies openly and
boldly but without knowing it, because it is her nature to
think herself always in the right, and she insults those who
contradict her. The servant submits wonderingly to the
demands made of her which are so foreign to her nature:
the hypocrisy of this pliant acquiescence is apparent in her
hysterical attacks when the conflict with her own sexual
emotions begins. It is because of this receptivity and susceptibility
that hysteria and the hysterical type of woman
are so leniently dealt with: it is this type, and not the
shrewish type, that will be cited in opposition to my views.<a id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote22"><a href="#FNanchor22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
It is the &#8220;yielding type&#8221; and not the virago type of woman
that men think capable of love. Such a woman&#8217;s love is only the
mental sense of satisfaction aroused by the maleness of some particular
man, and, therefore, it is only possible with the hysterical; it
has nothing to do with her individual power of loving, and can have
nothing to do with it. The bashfulness of woman is also due to
her &#8220;obsession&#8221; by one man; this also causes her neglect of all
other men.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Untruthfulness, organic untruthfulness, characterises both
types, and accordingly all women. It is quite wrong to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
that women lie. That would imply that they sometimes
speak the truth. Sincerity, <i>pro foro interno et externo</i>, is the
virtue of all others of which women are absolutely incapable,
which is impossible for them!</p>

<p>The point I am urging is that woman is never genuine at
any period of her life, not even when she, in hysteria,
slavishly accepts the aspect of truth laid on her by another,
and apparently speaks in accordance with those demands.</p>

<p>A woman can laugh, cry, blush, or even look wicked at
will: the shrew, when she has some object in view; the
&#8220;maid,&#8221; when she has to make a decision for herself. Men
have not the organic and physiological qualifications for
such dissimulation.</p>

<p>If we are able to show that the supposed love of truth
in these types of woman is no more than their natural
hypocrisy in a mask, it is only to be expected that all the
other qualities for which woman has been praised will suffer
under analysis. Her modesty, her self-respect, and her
religious fervour are loudly acclaimed. Womanly modesty,
none the less, is nothing but prudery, <i>i.e.</i>, an extravagant
denial and rejection of her natural immodesty. Whenever
a woman evinces any trace of what could really be called
modesty, hysteria is certainly answerable for it. The woman
who is absolutely unhysterical and not to be influenced,
<i>i.e.</i>, the absolute shrew, will not be ashamed of any reproaches
her husband may shower on her, however just;
incipient hysteria is present when a woman blushes under
her husband&#8217;s direct censure; but hysteria in its most
marked form is present when a woman blushes when she
is quite alone: it is only then that she may be said to be
fully impregnated with the masculine standard of values.</p>

<p>The women who most nearly approximate to what has
been called sexual an&aelig;sthesia or frigidity are always
hysterical, as Paul Solliers, with whom I entirely agree,
discovered. Sexual an&aelig;sthesia is merely one of the
many hysterical, that is to say, unreal, simulated forms of
an&aelig;sthesia. Oskar Vogt, in particular (and general observation
has confirmed him), proved that such an&aelig;sthesia<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
does not involve a real lack of sensation, but is simply due
to an inhibition which keeps certain sensations in check, and
excludes them from the consciousness.</p>

<p>If the an&aelig;sthetised arm of a hypnotised subject is pricked
a certain number of times, and the medium is told to say
how many times he has been pricked, he is able to do so,
although otherwise he would not have perceived them. So
also with sexual frigidity; it is an order given by the controlling
force of the super-imposed asexual ideas; but this,
like all other forms of an&aelig;sthesia, can be counteracted by a
sufficiently strong &#8220;order.&#8221;</p>

<p>The repulsion to sexuality in general shown by the
hysterical woman corresponds in its nature with her
insensibility to sexual matters in her own case. Such a
repulsion, an intense disinclination for everything sexual,
is really present in many women, and this may be urged
as an exception to my generalisation as to the universality
in woman of the match-making tendency. But women
who are made ill by discovering two people in sexual intercourse
are always hysterical. In this we have a special
justification of the theory which holds match-making to be
the true nature of woman, and which looks upon her own
sexuality as merely a special case of it. A woman may
be made hysterical not only by a sexual suggestion to herself
which she outwardly resists whilst inwardly assenting to it,
but may be just as much so by the sight of two people in
sexual intercourse, for, though she thinks the matter has no
value for her, her inborn assent to it forces itself through
all outward and artificial barriers, and overcomes the super-imposed
and incorporated method of thought in which she
usually lives. That is to say, she feels herself involved in
the sexual union of others.</p>

<p>Something similar takes place in the hysterical &#8220;consciousness
of guilt,&#8221; which has already been spoken about. The
absolute shrew never feels herself really in the wrong;
the woman who is slightly hysterical only feels so in the
presence of men; the woman who is thoroughly hysterical
feels it in the presence of the particular man who dominates<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
her. One cannot prove the existence of a sense of guilt in
woman by the mortifications to which &#8220;devotees&#8221; and
&#8220;penitents&#8221; subject themselves. It is these extreme cases
of self-discipline which make one suspicious. Doing
penance proves, in most cases, that the doer has not overcome
his fault, that the sense of guilt has not really entered
consciousness; it appears really to be much rather an
attempt to force repentance from the outside, to make up for
not really feeling it.</p>

<p>The difference between the conviction of guilt in
hysterical women and in men, and the origin of the
self-reproaches of the former, are of some importance.
When the hysterical woman realises that she has done or
thought something immoral, she tries to rectify it by
some code which she seeks to obey and to substitute in
her mind in place of the immoral thought. She does not
really get rid of the thought which is too deeply rooted in
her nature; she does not really face it, try to understand
it, and so purge herself of it. She simply, from point to
point, case by case, tries to adhere to the moral code without
ever transforming herself, reforming her idea. The moral
character in the woman is elaborated bit by bit; in the male
right conduct comes from moral character. The vow remodels
the whole man; the change takes place in the only
possible way, from within outwards, and leads to a real
morality which is not only a justification by works. The
morality of the woman is merely superficial and is not real
morality.</p>

<p>The current opinion that woman is religious is equally
erroneous. Female mysticism, when it is anything more
than mere superstition, is either thinly veiled sexuality (the
identification of the Deity and the lover has been frequently
discussed, as, for instance, in Maupassant&#8217;s &#8220;Bel-Ami,&#8221; or in
Hauptmann&#8217;s &#8220;Hannele&#8217;s Himmelfahrt&#8221;) as in numberless
spiritualists and theosophists, or it is a mere passive and
unconscious acceptance of man&#8217;s religious views which are
clung to the more firmly because of woman&#8217;s natural
disinclination for them. The lover is readily transformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
into a Saviour; very readily (as is well known to be the
case with many nuns) the Saviour becomes the lover. All
the great women visionaries known to history were hysterical;
the most famous, Santa Teresa, was not misnamed
&#8220;the patron saint of hysteria.&#8221; At any rate, if woman&#8217;s
religiousness were genuine, and if it proceeded from her
own nature, she would have done something great in the
religious world; but she never has done anything of any
importance. I should like to put shortly what I take to
be the difference between the masculine and feminine
creeds; man&#8217;s religion consists in a supreme belief in himself,
woman&#8217;s in a supreme belief in other people.</p>

<p>There is left to consider the self-respect which is often
described as being so highly developed in the hysterical. That
it is only man&#8217;s self-respect which has been so thoroughly
forced into woman, is clear from its nature and the way it
shows itself, as Vogt, who extended and verified experiments
first made by Freud, discovered from self-respect under
hypnotism. The extraneous masculine will creates by its
influence a &#8220;self-respecting&#8221; subject in the hypnotised
woman by inducing a limitation of the field of the unhypnotised
state. Apart from suggestion, in the ordinary
life of the hysterical it is only the man with whom they
are &#8220;impregnated&#8221; who is respected in them. Any
knowledge of human nature which women have comes
from their absorption of the right sort of man. In the
paroxysms of hysteria this artificial self-respect disappears
with the revolt of oppressed nature.</p>

<p>This is quite parallel to the clairvoyance of hysterical
mediums, which is undoubted, but has as little to do with
&#8220;occult&#8221; spiritism as the ordinary hypnotic phenomena.
Just as Vogt&#8217;s patients made strenuous efforts to observe
themselves carefully under the powerful will of the
suggestor, the clairvoyante, under the influence of the
dominating voice of the man who is imposing his will on
her, is capable of telepathic performances, and at his
command can, blindfolded, read communications held
by people unknown to her at a great distance away;<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
this I saw happen at M&uuml;nchen under circumstances which
precluded any chance of fraud.</p>

<p>In woman there are not strong passions opposed to the
desire for the good and true as is the case with man. The
masculine will has more power over woman than over the
man himself; it can realise something in women which, in
his own case, has to encounter too many obstacles. He
himself has to battle with an anti-moral and anti-logical
opposition in himself. The masculine will can obtain such
power over woman&#8217;s mind that he makes her, in a sense,
clairvoyant, and breaks down her limitations of mentality.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that woman is more telepathic than
man, can appear more innocent, and can accomplish more
as a &#8220;seer,&#8221; and it is only when she becomes a medium, <i>i.e.</i>,
the object, that she realises in herself most easily and surely
the masculine will for the good and true. Wala can be
made to understand, but not until Dotan subdues her. She
meets him half-way, for her one desire is to be conquered.</p>

<p>The subject of hysteria, so far as the purposes of this
book are concerned, is now exhausted.</p>

<p>The women who are uniformly quoted as proofs of
female morality are always of the hysterical type, and it is
the very observance of morality, in doing things according
to the moral law as if this moral law were a law of their
personality instead of being only an acquired habit, that
the unreality, the immorality of this morality is shown.</p>

<p>The hysterical diathesis is an absurd imitation of the
masculine mind, a parody of free will which woman parades
at the very moment when she is most under a masculine
influence.</p>

<p>Woman is not a free agent; she is altogether subject to
her desire to be under man&#8217;s influence, herself and all
others: she is under the sway of the phallus, and irretrievably
succumbs to her destiny, even if it leads to
actively developed sexuality. At the most a woman can
reach an indistinct feeling of her un-freedom, a cloudy
idea of the possibility of controlling her destiny&mdash;manifestly
only a flickering spark of the free, intelligible subject,<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
the scanty remains of inherited maleness in her, which, by
contrast, gives her even this slight comprehension. It is
also impossible for a woman to have a clear idea of her
destiny, or of the forces within her: it is only he who is free
who can discern fate, because he is not chained by
necessity; part of his personality, at least, places him in
the position of spectator and a combatant outside his own
fate and makes him so far superior to it. One of the most
conclusive proofs of human freedom is contained in the
fact that man has been able to create the idea of causality.
Women consider themselves most free when they are most
bound; and they are not troubled by the passions, because
they are simply the embodiment of them. It is only a man
who can talk of the &#8220;dira necessitas&#8221; within him; it is only
he could have created the idea of destiny, because it is only
he who, in addition to the empirical, conditioned existence,
possesses a free, intelligible ego.</p>

<p>As I have shown, woman can reach no more than a
vague half-consciousness of the fact that she is a conditioned
being, and so she is unable to overcome the sexuality that
binds her. Hysteria is the only attempt on her part to
overcome it, and, as I have shown, it is not a genuine
attempt. The hysteria itself is what the hysterical woman
tries to resist, and the falsity of this effort against slavery is
the measure of its hopelessness. The most notable examples
of the sex (I have in mind Hebbel&#8217;s Judith and Wagner&#8217;s
Kundry) may feel that is because they wish it that servitude
is a necessity for them, but this realisation does not give
them power to resist it; at the last moment they will kiss
the man who ravishes them, and succumb with pleasure to
those whom they have been resisting violently. It is as if
woman were under a curse. At times she feels the weight
of it, but she never flees from it. Her shrieks and ravings
are not really genuine, and she succumbs to her fate at the
moment when it has seemed most repulsive to her.</p>

<p>After a long analysis, then, it has been found that there
is no exception to the complete absence in women of any
true, inalienable relation to worth. Even what is covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
by such current terms as &#8220;womanly love,&#8221; &#8220;womanly
virtue,&#8221; &#8220;womanly devoutness,&#8221; &#8220;womanly modesty,&#8221; has
failed to invalidate my conclusions. I have maintained my
ground in face of the strongest opposition, even including
that which comes from woman&#8217;s hysterical imitations of the
male morality.</p>

<p>Woman, the normal receptive woman of whom I am
speaking, is impregnated by the man not only physically
(and I set down the astonishing mental alteration in
women after marriage to a physical phenomenon akin to
telegony), but at every age of her life, by man&#8217;s consciousness
and by man&#8217;s social arrangements. Thus it comes
about that although woman lacks all the characters of the
male sex, she can assume them so cleverly and so slavishly
that it is possible to make mistakes such as the idea of the
higher morality of women.</p>

<p>But this astounding receptivity of woman is not isolated,
and must be brought into practical and theoretical connection
with the other positive and negative characteristics
of woman.</p>

<p>What has the match-making instinct in woman to do with
her plasticity? What connection is there between her
untruthfulness and her sexuality? How does it come
about that there is such a strange mixture of all these
things in woman?</p>

<p>This brings us to ask the reason why women can
assimilate everything. Whence does she derive the
falsity which makes it possible for her to prefer to
believe only what others have told her, to have only
what they (choose to) give her, to be merely what they
make her?</p>

<p>In order to give the right answer to these questions we
must turn once more, for the last time, from the actual point.
It was found that the power of recognition which animals
possess, and which is the psychical equivalent of universal
organic response to repeated stimuli, was curiously like and
unlike human memory; both signify an equally lasting
influence of an impression which was limited to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
definite period; but memory is differentiated from mere
passive recognition by its power of actively reproducing
the past.</p>

<p>Later on, it was seen that mere individuation, the characteristic
of all organic differentiation, and individuality, man&#8217;s
possession, are different. And finally it was found that it
was necessary to distinguish carefully between love, peculiar
to man, and the sexual instinct, shared by the animals.
The two are allied inasmuch as they are both efforts at
immortality.</p>

<p>The desire for worth was referred to as a human character,
absent in the animals where there is only a desire
for satisfaction. The two are analogous, and yet fundamentally
different. Pleasure is craved; worth is what
we feel we ought to crave. The two have been confused,
with the worst results for psychology and ethics.
There has been a similar confusion between personality
and persons, between recognition and memory, sexuality
and love.</p>

<p>All these antitheses have been continually confused, and,
what is even more striking, almost always by men with the
same views and theories, and with the same object&mdash;that of
trying to obliterate the difference between man and the
lower animals.</p>

<p>There are other less known distinctions which have been
equally neglected. Limited consciousness is an animal trait;
the active power of noticing is a purely human one. It is
evident that there is something in common in the two facts,
but still they are very different. Desire, or impulse, and will
are nearly always spoken of as if they were identical. The
former is common to all living creatures, but man has, in
addition, a will, which is free, and no factor of psychology,
because it is the foundation of all psychological experiences.
The identification of impulse and will is not solely due to
Darwin; it occurred also in Schopenhauer&#8217;s conception of
the will, which was sometimes biological, sometimes purely
philosophical.</p>

<p>I may group the two sets of factors as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page282">[282]</span></p>

<table class="factorsets" summary="Factors">

<p>The series shows that man possesses not only each
character which is found in all living things, but also an
analogous and higher character peculiar to himself. The
old tendency at once to identify the two series and to contrast
them seems to show the existence of something binding
together the two series, and at the same time separating
them. One may recall in this connection the Buddhistic
conception of there being in man a superstructure added to
the characters of lower existences. It is as if man possessed
all the properties of the beasts, with, in each case, some
special quality added. What is this that has been added?
How far does it resemble, and in what respects does it differ
from, the more primitive set?</p>

<p>The terms in the left-hand row are fundamental characteristics
of all animal and vegetable life. All such life is
individual life, not the life of undivided masses; it manifests
itself as the impulse to satisfy needs, as sexual impulse for
the purpose of reproduction. Individuality, memory, will,
love, are those qualities of a second life, which, although
related to organic life to a certain extent, are <i>toto c&#339;lo</i>
different from it.</p>

<p>This brings us face to face with the religious idea of the
eternal, higher, <i>new</i> life, and especially with the Christian
form of it.</p>

<p>As well as a share in organic life, man shares another
life, the &#950;&#969;&#951; &#945;&#953;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962; of the New Dispensation. Just as all
earthly life is sustained by earthly food, this other life<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
requires spiritual sustenance (symbolised in the communion
service). The birth and death of the former have their
counterparts in the latter&mdash;the moral re-birth of man, the &#8220;regeneration&#8221;&mdash;and
the end: the final loss of the soul through
error or crime. The one is determined from without by
the bonds of natural causation; the other is ruled by the
moral imperative from within. The one is limited and
confined to a definite purpose; the other is unlimited,
eternal and moral. The characters which are in the left
row are common to all forms of lower life; those in the
right-hand column are the corresponding presages of eternal
life, manifestations of a higher existence in which man, and
only man, has a share. The perpetual intermingling and
the fresh complications which arise between the higher
and lower natures are the making of all history of the human
mind; this is the plot of the history of the universe.</p>

<p>It is possible that some may perceive in this second life
something which in man might have been derived from the
other lower characters; such a possibility dismiss at once.</p>

<p>A clearer grasp of this sensuous, impressionable lower
life will make it clear that, as I have explained in earlier
chapters, the case is reversed; the lower life is merely a
projection of the higher on the world of the senses, a
reflection of it in the sphere of necessity, as a degradation
of it, or its Fall. And the great problem is how the eternal,
lofty idea came to be bound with earth. This problem is
the guilt of the world. My investigation is now on the
threshold of what cannot be investigated; of a problem
that so far no one has dared to answer, and that never will
be answered by any human being. It is the riddle of the
universe and of life; the binding of the unlimited in the
bonds of space, of the eternal in time, of the spirit in
matter. It is the relation of freedom to necessity, of something
to nothing, of God to the devil. The dualism of the
world is beyond comprehension; it is the plot of the story
of man&#8217;s Fall, the primitive riddle. It is the binding of
eternal life in a perishable being, of the innocent in the
guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span></p>

<p>But it is evident that neither I nor any other man can
understand this. I can understand sin only when I cease
to commit it, and the moment I understand it I cease to
commit it. So also I can never comprehend life while I am
still alive. There is no moment of my life when I am not
bound down by this sham existence, and it must be impossible
for me to understand the bond until I am free from it.
When I understand a thing I am already outside it; I
cannot comprehend my sinfulness while I am still sinful.</p>

<p>As the absolute female has no trace of individuality and
will, no sense of worth or of love, she can have no part
in the higher, transcendental life. The intelligible, hyperempirical
existence of the male transcends matter, space,
and time. He is certainly mortal, but he is immortal as
well. And so he has the power to choose between the two,
between the life which is lost with death and the life to
which death is only a stepping-stone. The deepest will of
man is towards this perfect, timeless existence; he is compact
of the desire for immortality. That the woman has no
craving for perpetual life is too apparent; there is nothing
in her of that eternal which man tries to interpose and
must interpose between his real self and his projected,
empirical self. Some sort of relation to the idea of supreme
value, to the idea of the absolute, that perfect freedom which
he has not yet attained, because he is bound by necessity,
but which he can attain because mind is superior to matter;
such a relation to the purpose of things generally, or to the
divine, every man has. And although his life on earth is
accompanied by separation and detachment from the absolute,
his mind is always longing to be free from the taint of
original sin.</p>

<p>Just as the love of his parents was not pure in purpose,
but sought more or less a physical embodiment, the son,
who is the outcome of that love, will possess his share of
mortal life as well as of eternal: we are horrified at the thought
of death, we fight against it, cling to this mortal life, and
prove from that that we were anxious to be born as we
were born, and that we still desire to be born of this world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span></p>

<p>But since every male has a relation to the idea of the
highest value, and would be incomplete without it, no male
is really ever happy. It is only women who are happy.
No man is happy, because he has a relation to freedom, and
yet during his earthly life he is always bound in some way.
None but a perfectly passive being, such as the absolute
female, or a universally active being, like the divine, can be
happy. Happiness is the sense of perfect consummation,
and this feeling a man can never have; but there are women
who fancy themselves perfect. The male always has problems
behind him and efforts before him: all problems
originate in the past; the future is the sphere for efforts.
Time has no objective, no meaning, for woman; no woman
questions herself as to the reason of her existence; and yet
the sole purpose of time is to give expression to the fact
that this life can and must mean something.</p>

<p>Happiness for the male! That would imply wholly independent
activity, complete freedom; he is always bound,
although not with the heaviest bonds, and his sense of guilt
increases the further he is removed from the idea of freedom.</p>

<p>Mortal life is a calamity, and must remain so whilst
mankind is a passive victim of sensation; so long as he
remains not form, but merely the matter on which form is
impressed. Every man, however, has some glimmer of
higher things; the genius most certainly and most directly.
This trace of light, however, does not come from his perceptions;
so far as he is ruled by these, man is merely a
passive victim of surrounding things. His spontaneity, his
freedom, come from his power of judging as to values,
and his highest approach to absolute spontaneity and freedom
comes from love and from artistic or philosophical
creation. Through these he obtains some faint sense of
what happiness might be.</p>

<p>Woman can really never be quite unhappy, for happiness
is an empty word for her, a word created by unhappy men.
Women never mind letting others see their unhappiness, as
it is not real; behind it there lies no consciousness of guilt,
no sense of the sin of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span></p>

<p>The last and absolute proof of the thoroughly negative
character of woman&#8217;s life, of her complete want of a higher
existence, is derived from the way in which women commit
suicide.</p>

<p>Such suicides are accompanied practically always by
thoughts of other people, what they will think, how they
will mourn over them, how grieved&mdash;or angry&mdash;they will
be. Every woman is convinced that her unhappiness is
undeserved at the time she kills herself; she pities herself
exceedingly with the sort of self-compassion which is only
a &#8220;weeping with others when they weep.&#8221;</p>

<p>How is it possible for a woman to look upon her unhappiness
as personal when she possesses no idea of a
destiny? The most appallingly decisive proof of the emptiness
and nullity of women is that they never once succeed
in knowing the problem of their own lives, and death leaves
them ignorant of it, because they are unable to realise the
higher life of personality.</p>

<p>I am now ready to answer the question which I put
forward as the chief object of this portion of my book, the
question as to the significance of the male and female in the
universe. Women have no existence and no essence; they
are not, they are nothing. Mankind occurs as male or
female, as something or nothing. Woman has no share in
ontological reality, no relation to the thing-in-itself, which,
in the deepest interpretation, is the absolute, is God. Man
in his highest form, the genius, has such a relation, and for
him the absolute is either the conception of the highest
worth of existence, in which case he is a philosopher; or it
is the wonderful fairyland of dreams, the kingdom of absolute
beauty, and then he is an artist. But both views mean
the same. Woman has no relation to the idea, she neither
affirms nor denies it; she is neither moral nor anti-moral;
mathematically speaking, she has no sign; she is purposeless,
neither good nor bad, neither angel nor devil, never egoistical
(and therefore has often been said to be altruistic); she
is as non-moral as she is non-logical. But all existence is
moral and logical existence. So woman has no existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span></p>

<p>Woman is untruthful. An animal has just as little metaphysical
reality as the actual woman, but it cannot speak,
and consequently it does not lie. In order to speak the
truth one must <i>be</i> something; truth is dependent on an
existence, and only that can have a relation to an existence
which is in itself something. Man desires truth all the
time; that is to say, he all along desires only to be something.
The cognition-impulse is in the end identical with
the desire for immortality. Any one who objects to a statement
without ever having realised it; any one who gives
outward acquiescence without the inner affirmation, such
persons, like woman, have no real existence and must of
necessity lie. So that woman always lies, even if, objectively,
she speaks the truth.</p>

<p>Woman is the great emissary of pairing. The living units
of the lower forms of life are individuals, organisms; the
living units of the higher forms of life are individualities,
souls, monads, &#8220;meta-organisms,&#8221; a term which Hellenbach
uses and which is not without point.</p>

<p>Each monad, however, is differentiated from every other
monad, and is as distinct from it as only two things can be.
Monads have no windows, but, instead, have the universe
in themselves. Man as monad, as a potential or actual
individuality, that is, as having genius, has in addition
differentiation and distinction, individuation and discrimination;
the simple undifferentiated unit is exclusively female.
Each monad creates for itself a detached entity, a whole;
but it looks upon every other ego as a perfect totality also,
and never intrudes upon it. Man has limits, and accepts
them and desires them; woman, who does not recognise
her own entity, is not in a position to regard or perceive
the privacy of those around her, and neither respects, nor
honours, nor leaves it alone: as there is no such thing as
one-ness for her there can be no plurality, only an
indistinct state of fusion with others. Because there is no
&#8220;I&#8221; in woman she cannot grasp the &#8220;thou&#8221;; according to
her perception the I and thou are just a pair, an undifferentiated
one; this makes it possible for woman to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
people together, to match-make. The object of her love is
that of her sympathy&mdash;the community, the blending of
everything.<a id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote23"><a href="#FNanchor23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> All individuality is an enemy of the community. This is seen
most markedly in men of genius, but it is just the same with regard
to the sexes.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Woman has no limits to her ego which could be broken
through, and which she would have to guard.</p>

<p>The chief difference between man&#8217;s and woman&#8217;s friendship
is referable to this fact. Man&#8217;s friendship is an attempt
to see eye to eye with those who individually and collectively
are striving after the same idea; woman&#8217;s friendship
is a combination for the purpose of match-making. It is
the only kind of intimate and unreserved intercourse
possible between women, when they are not merely
anxious to meet each other for the purpose of gossiping or
discussing every day affairs.<a id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote24"><a href="#FNanchor24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
Men&#8217;s friendships avoid breaking down their friends&#8217; personal
reserve. Women expect intimacy from their friends.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If, for instance, one of two girls or women is much
prettier than the other, the plainer of the two experiences a
certain sexual satisfaction at the admiration which the
other receives. The principal condition of all friendship
between women is the exclusion of rivalry; every woman
compares herself physically with every woman she gets to
know. In cases where one is more beautiful than the other,
the plainer of the two will idolise the other, because, though
neither of them is in the least conscious of it, the next best
thing to her own sexual satisfaction for the one is the
success of the other; it is always the same; woman participates
in every sexual union. The completely impersonal
existence of women, as well as the super-individual nature
of their sexuality, clearly shows match-making to be the
fundamental trait of their beings.</p>

<p>The least that even the ugliest woman demands, and
from which she derives a certain amount of pleasure, is
that any one of her sex should be admired and desired.</p>

<p>It follows from the absorbing and absorbable nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span>
woman&#8217;s life that women can never feel really jealous.
However ignoble jealousy and the spirit of revenge may be,
they both contain an element of greatness, of which
women, whether for good or evil, are incapable. In
jealousy there lies a despairing claim to an assumed right,
and the idea of justice is out of woman&#8217;s reach. But that
is not the chief reason why a woman can never be really
jealous of any man. If a man, even if he were the man she
was madly in love with, were sitting in the next room
making love to another woman, the thoughts that would be
aroused in her breast would be so sexually exciting that
they would leave no room for jealousy. To a man, such a
scene, if he knew of it, would be absolutely repulsive, and
it would be nauseous to him to be near it; woman would
feverishly follow each detail, or she would become hysterical
if it dawned on her what she was doing.</p>

<p>A man is never really affected by the idea of the pairing
of others: he is outside and above any such circumstance
which has no meaning for him; a woman, however, would
be scarcely responsible for her interest in the process, she
would be in a state of feverish excitement and as if spellbound
by the thought of her proximity to it.</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s interest in his fellow men, who are problems for
him, may extend to their sexual affairs; but the curiosity
which is specially for these things is peculiar to woman,
whether with regard to men or women. It is the love
affairs of a man which, from first to last, interest women;
and a man is only intellectually mysterious and charming
to a woman so long as she is not clear as to these.</p>

<p>From all this it is again manifest that femaleness and
match-making are identical; even a superficial study of the
case would have resulted in the same conclusions. But I
had a much wider purpose, and I hope I have clearly
shown the connection between woman positive as match-maker,
and woman negative as utterly lacking in the higher
life. Woman has but one idea, an idea she cannot be
conscious of, as it is her sole idea, and that is absolutely
opposed to the spiritual idea. Whether as a mother seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
reputable matrimony, or the Bacchante of the Venusberg,
whether she wishes to be the foundress of a family, or is
content to be lost in the maze of pleasure-seekers, she
always is in relation to the general idea of the race as a
whole of which she is an inseparable part, and she follows
the instinct which most of all makes for community.</p>

<p>She, as the missionary of union, must be a creature
without limits or individuality. I have prolonged this side
of my investigation because its important result has been
omitted from all earlier characterology.</p>

<p>At this stage it well may be asked if women are really to
be considered human beings at all, or if my theory does not
unite them with plants and animals? For, according to
the theory, women, just as little as plants and animals,
have any real existence, any relation to the intelligible
whole. Man alone is a microcosm, a mirror of the
universe.</p>

<p>In Ibsen&#8217;s &#8220;Little Eyolf&#8221; there is a beautiful and apposite
passage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rita. &#8216;After all, we are only human beings.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allmers. &#8216;But we have some kinship with the sky and
the sea, Rita.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rita. &#8216;You, perhaps; not me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Woman, according to the poet, according to Buddha, and
in my interpretation, has no relation to the all, to the world
whole, to God. Is she then human, or an animal, or a
plant?</p>

<p>Anatomists will find the question ridiculous, and will at
once dismiss the philosophy which could lead up to such a
possibility. For them woman is the female of <i>Homo
sapiens</i>, differentiated from all other living beings, and
occupying the same position with regard to the human
male that the females of other species occupy with regard
to their males. And he will not allow the philosopher to
say, &#8220;What has the anatomist to do with me? Let him
mind his own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, women are sisters of the flowers, and
are in close relationship with the animals. Many of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
sexual perversities and affections for animals (Pasiph&auml;e myth
and Leda myth) indicate this. But they are human beings.
Even the absolute woman, whom we think of as without
any trace of intelligible ego, is still the complement of man.
And there is no doubt that the fact of the special sexual and
erotic completion of the human male by the human female,
even if it is not the moral phenomenon which advocates of
marriage would have us believe, is still of tremendous importance
to the woman problem. Animals are mere individuals;
women are persons, although they are not personalities.</p>

<p>An appearance of discriminative power, though not the
reality, language, though not conversation, memory, though
it has no continuity or unity of consciousness&mdash;must all be
granted to them.</p>

<p>They possess counterfeits of everything masculine, and
thus are subject to those transformations which the defenders
of womanliness are so fond of quoting. The result
of this is a sort of amphi-sexuality of many ideas (honour,
shame, love, imagination, fear, sensibility, and so on), which
have both a masculine and feminine significance.</p>

<p>There now remains to discuss the real meaning of the
contrast between the sexes.</p>

<p>The parts played by the male and female principles in the
animal and vegetable kingdoms are not now under consideration;
we are dealing solely with humanity.</p>

<p>That such principles of maleness and femaleness must be
accepted as theoretical conceptions, and not as metaphysical
ideas, was the point of this investigation from the beginning.
The whole object of the book has been to settle the question,
in man at least, of the really important differences between
man and woman, quite apart from the mere physiological-sexual differentiation.
Furthermore, the view which sees
nothing more in the fact of the dualism of the sexes than
an arrangement for physiological division of labour&mdash;an
idea for which, I believe, the zoologist, Milne-Edwards, is
responsible&mdash;appears, according to this work, quite untenable;
and it is useless to waste time discussing such a
superficial and intellectually complacent view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span></p>

<p>Darwinism, indeed, is responsible for making popular the
view that sexually differentiated organisms have been derived
from earlier stages in which there was no sexual
dimorphism; but long before Darwin, Gustav Theodor
Fechner had already shown that the sexes could not be
supposed to have arisen from an undifferentiated stage by
any principle such as division of labour, adaptation to the
struggle for existence, and so forth.</p>

<p>The ideas &#8220;man&#8221; and &#8220;woman&#8221; cannot be investigated
separately; their significance can be found out only by
placing them side by side and contrasting them. The key
to their natures must be found in their relations to each
other. In attempting to discover the nature of erotics I
went a little way into this subject. The relation of man to
woman is simply that of subject to object. Woman seeks
her consummation as the object. She is the plaything of
husband or child, and, however we may try to hide it, she
is anxious to be nothing but such a chattel.</p>

<p>No one misunderstands so thoroughly what a woman
wants as he who tries to find out what is passing within
her, endeavouring to share her feelings and hopes, her
experiences and her real nature.</p>

<p>Woman does not wish to be treated as an active agent;
she wants to remain always and throughout&mdash;this is just her
womanhood&mdash;purely passive, to feel herself under another&#8217;s
will. She demands only to be desired physically, to be
taken possession of, like a new property.</p>

<p>Just as mere sensation only attains reality when it is
apprehended, <i>i.e.</i>, when it becomes objective, so a woman
is brought to a sense of her existence only by her husband
or children&mdash;by these as subjects to whom she is the object&mdash;so
obtaining the gift of an existence.</p>

<p>The contrast between the subject and the object in the
theory of knowledge corresponds ontologically to the contrast
between form and matter. It is no more than a
translation of this distinction from the theory of experience
to metaphysics. Matter, which in itself is absolutely unindividualised
and so can assume any form, of itself has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
definite and lasting qualities, and has as little essence as
mere perception, the matter of experience, has in itself any
existence. If the Platonic conception is followed out, it will
be apparent that that great thinker asserted to be nothing
what the ordinary Philistine regards as the highest form of
reality. According to Plato, the negation of existence is no
other than matter. Form is the only real existence. Aristotle
carried the Platonic conception into the regions of biology.
For Plato form is the parent and creator of all reality. For
Aristotle, in the sexual process the male principle is the
active, formative agent, the female principle the passive
matter on which the form is impressed. In my view, the
significance of woman in humanity is explained by the
Platonic and Aristotelian conception. Woman is the
material on which man acts. Man as the microcosm
is compounded of the lower and higher life. Woman is
matter, is nothing. This knowledge gives us the keystone
to our structure, and it makes everything clear that was
indistinct, it gives things a coherent form. Woman&#8217;s sexual
part depends on contact; it is the absorbing and not the
liberating impulse. It coincides with this, that the keenest
sense woman has, and the only one she has more highly
developed than man, is the sense of touch. The eye and
the ear lead to the unlimited and give glimpses of infinity;
the sense of touch necessitates physical limitations to our
own actions: one is affected by what one feels; it is the
eminently sordid sense, and suited to the physical requirements
of an earth-bound being.</p>

<p>Man is form, woman is matter: if that is so it must find
expression in the relations between their respective psychic
experiences.</p>

<p>The summing up of the connected nature of man&#8217;s
mental life, as opposed to the inarticulate and chaotic condition
of woman&#8217;s, illustrates the above antithesis of form
and matter.</p>

<p>Matter needs to be formed: and thus woman demands
that man should clear her confusion of thought, give
meaning to her henid ideas. Women are matter, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
can assume any shape. Those experiments which ascribe
to girls a better memory for learning by rote than boys are
explained in this way: they are due to the nullity and
inanity of women, who can be saturated with anything and
everything, whilst man only retains what has an interest
for him, forgetting all else.</p>

<p>This accounts for what has been called woman&#8217;s submissiveness,
the way she is influenced by the opinions of others,
her suggestibility, the way in which man moulds her formless
nature. Woman is nothing; therefore, and only therefore,
she can become everything, whilst man can only remain
what he is. A man can make what he likes of a woman:
the most a woman can do is to help a man to achieve what
he wants.</p>

<p>A man&#8217;s real nature is never altered by education: woman,
on the other hand, by external influences, can be taught to
suppress her most characteristic self, the real value she sets
on sexuality.</p>

<p>Woman can appear everything and deny everything, but
in reality she is never anything.</p>

<p>Women have neither this nor that characteristic; their
peculiarity consists in having no characteristics at all; the
complexity and terrible mystery about women come to this;
it is this which makes them above and beyond man&#8217;s understanding&mdash;man,
who always wants to get to the heart of
things.</p>

<p>It may be said, even by those who may wish to agree
with the foregoing arguments, that they have not indicated
what man really is. Has he any special male characteristics,
like match-making and want of character in women? Is
there a definite idea of what man is, as there is of woman,
and can this idea be similarly formulated?</p>

<p>Here is the answer: The idea of maleness consists in the
fact of an individuality, of an essential monad, and is covered
by it. Each monad, however, is as different as possible from
every other monad, and therefore cannot be classified in
one comprehensive idea common to many other monads.
Man is the microcosm; he contains all kinds of possibilities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
This must not be confused with the universal susceptibility
of woman who becomes all without <i>being</i> anything, whilst
man is all, as much or as little, according to his gifts, as he
will. Man contains woman, for he contains matter, and he
can allow this part of his nature to develop itself, <i>i.e.</i>, to
thrive and enervate him; or he can recognise and fight
against it&mdash;so that he, and he alone, can get at the truth
about woman. But woman cannot develop except through
man.</p>

<p>The meaning of man and woman is first arrived at when
we examine their mutual sexual and erotic relations.
Woman&#8217;s deepest desire is to be formed by man, and so to
receive her being. Woman desires that man should impart
opinions to her quite different to those she held before,
she is content to let herself be turned by him from what she
had till then thought right. She wishes to be taken to
pieces as a whole, so that he may build her up again.</p>

<p>Woman is first created by man&#8217;s will&mdash;he dominates her
and changes her whole being (hypnotism). Here is the
explanation of the relation of the psychical to the physical
in man and woman. Man assumes a reciprocal action of
body and mind, in the sense rather that the dominant mind
creates the body, than that the mind merely projects itself
on phenomena, whilst the woman accepts both mental and
psychical phenomena empirically. None the less, even
in the woman there is some reciprocal action. However,
whilst in the man, as Schopenhauer truly taught, the human
being is his own creation, his own will makes and re-makes
the body, the woman is bodily influenced and changed by
an alien will (suggestion).</p>

<p>Man not only forms himself, but woman also&mdash;a far easier
matter. The myths of the book of Genesis and other cosmogonies,
which teach that woman was created out of man,
are nearer the truth than the biological theories of descent,
according to which males have been evolved from females.</p>

<p>We have now to come to the question left open in
chap. ix., as to how woman, who is herself without soul or
will, is yet able to realise to what extent a man may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
endowed with them; and we may now endeavour to answer
it. Of this one must be certain, that what woman notices,
that for which she has a sense, is not the special nature of
man, but only the general fact and possibly the grade of his
maleness. It is quite erroneous to suppose that woman has
an innate capacity to understand the individuality of a man.
The lover, who is so easily fooled by the unconscious simulation
of a deeper comprehension on the part of his sweetheart,
may believe that he understands himself through a
girl; but those who are less easily satisfied cannot help
seeing that women only possess a sense of the fact not of
the individuality of the soul, only for the formal general
fact, not for the differentiation of the personality. In order
to perceive and apperceive the special form, matter must not
itself be formless; woman&#8217;s relation to man, however, is
nothing but that of matter to form, and her comprehension
of him nothing but willingness to be as much formed as
possible by him; the instinct of those without existence for
existence. Furthermore, this &#8220;comprehension&#8221; is not
theoretical, it is not sympathetic, it is only a desire to be
sympathetic; it is importunate and egoistical. Woman has
no relation to man and no sense of man, but only for maleness;
and if she is to be considered as more sexual than
man, this greater claim is nothing but the intense desire for
the fullest and most definite formation, it is the demand for
the greatest possible quantity of existence.</p>

<p>And, finally, match-making is nothing else than this. The
sexuality of women is super-individual, because they are not
limited, formed, individualised entities, in the higher sense
of the word.</p>

<p>The supremest moment in a woman&#8217;s life, when her
original nature, her natural desire manifests itself, is that in
which her own sexual union takes place. She embraces the
man passionately and presses him to her; it is the greatest
joy of passivity, stronger even than the contented feeling of a
hypnotised person, the desire of matter which has just been
formed, and wishes to keep that form for ever. That is why
a woman is so grateful to her possessor, even if the gratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
is limited to the moment, as in the case of prostitutes with
no memory, or, if it lasts longer, as in the case of more
highly differentiated women.</p>

<p>This endless striving of the poor to attach themselves to
riches, the altogether formless and therefore super-individual
striving of the inarticulate to obtain form by contact, to keep
it indefinitely and so gain an existence, is the deepest motive
in pairing.</p>

<p>Pairing is only possible because woman is not a monad,
and has no sense of individuality; it is the endless striving
of nothing to be something.</p>

<p>It is thus that the duality of man and woman has
gradually developed into complete dualism, to the dualism
of the higher and lower lives, of subject and object, of
form and matter, something and nothing. All metaphysical,
all transcendental existence is logical and moral
existence; woman is non-logical and non-moral. She has
no dislike for what is logical and moral, she is not anti-logical,
she is not anti-moral. She is not the negation, she
is, rather, nothing. She is neither the affirmation nor the
denial. A man has in himself the possibility of being the
absolute something or the absolute nothing, and therefore
his actions are directed towards the one or the other; woman
does not sin, for she herself is the sin which is a possibility
in man.</p>

<p>The abstract male is the image of God, the absolute something;
the female, and the female element in the male, is the
symbol of nothing; that is the significance of the woman
in the universe, and in this way male and female complete
and condition one another. Woman has a meaning and a
function in the universe as the opposite of man; and as
the human male surpasses the animal male, so the human
female surpasses the female of zoology. It is not that
limited existence and limited negation (as in the animal
kingdom) are at war in humanity; what there stand in
opposition are unlimited existence and unlimited negation.
And so male and female make up humanity.</p>

<p>The meaning of woman is to be meaningless. She represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
negation, the opposite pole from the Godhead, the
other possibility of humanity. And so nothing is so despicable
as a man become female, and such a person will be
regarded as the supreme criminal even by himself. And
so also is to be explained the deepest fear of man; the fear
of the woman, which is the fear of unconsciousness, the
alluring abyss of annihilation.</p>

<p>An old woman manifests once for all what woman really
is. The beauty of woman, as may be experimentally proved,
is only created by love of a man; a woman becomes more
beautiful when a man loves her because she is passively
responding to the will which is in her lover; however
deep this may sound, it is only a matter of everyday
experience.</p>

<p>All the qualities of woman depend on her non-existence,
on her want of character; because she has no true, permanent,
but only a mortal life, in her character as the
advocate of pairing she furthers the sexual part of life, and
is fundamentally transformed by and susceptible to the man
who has a physical influence over her.</p>

<p>Thus the three fundamental characters of woman with
which this chapter has dealt come together in the conception
of her as the non-existent. Her instability and
untruthfulness are only negative deductions from the
premiss of her non-existence. Her only positive character,
the conception of her as the pairing agent, comes from it
by a simple process of analysis. The nature of woman is
no more than pairing, no more than super-individual
sexuality.</p>

<p>If we turn to the table of the two kinds of life given
earlier in this chapter, it will be apparent that every inclination
from the higher to the lower is a crime against oneself.
Immorality is the will towards negation, the craving to
change the formed into the formless, the wish for
destruction. And from this comes the intimate relation
between femaleness and crime. There is a close relation
between the immoral and the non-moral. It is only when
man accepts his own sexuality, denies the absolute in him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
turns to the lower, that he gives woman existence. The
acceptance of the Phallus is immoral. It has always been
thought of as hateful; it has been the image of Satan, and
Dante made it the central pillar of hell.</p>

<p>Thus comes about the domination of the male sexuality
over the female. It is only when man is sexual that woman
has existence and meaning.</p>

<p>Her existence is bound up with the Phallus, and so that
is her supreme lord and welcome master.</p>

<p>Sex, in the form of man, is woman&#8217;s fate; the Don Juan
is the only type of man who has complete power over her.</p>

<p>The curse, which was said to be heavy on woman, is the
evil will of man: nothing is only a tool in the hand of the
will for nothing. The early Fathers expressed it pathetically
when they called woman the handmaid of the devil. For
matter in itself is nothing, it can only obtain existence
through form. The fall of &#8220;form&#8221; is the corruption that
takes place when form endeavours to relapse into the formless.
When man became sexual he formed woman. That
woman is at all has happened simply because man has
accepted his sexuality. Woman is merely the result of this
affirmation; she is sexuality itself. Woman&#8217;s existence is
dependent on man; when man, as man, in contradistinction
to woman, is sexual, he is giving woman form, calling her
into existence. Therefore woman&#8217;s one object must be to
keep man sexual. She desires man as Phallus, and for this
she is the advocate of pairing. She is incapable of making
use of any creature except as a means to an end, the end
being pairing; and she has but one purpose, that of continuing
the guilt of man, for she would disappear the
moment man had overcome his sexuality.</p>

<p>Man created woman, and will always create her afresh,
as long as he is sexual. Just as he gives woman consciousness,
so he gives her existence. Woman is the sin of
man.</p>

<p>He tries to pay the debt by love. Here we have the
explanation of what seemed like an obscure myth at the
end of the previous chapter. Now we see what was hidden in<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
it: that woman is nothing before man&#8217;s fall, nor without it;
that he does not rob her of anything she had before. The
crime man has committed in creating woman, and still
commits in assenting to her purpose, he excuses to woman
by his eroticism.</p>

<p>Whence otherwise would come the generosity of love,
which can never be satisfied by giving? How is it that
love is so anxious to endow woman with a soul, and not
any other creature? Whence comes it that a child cannot
love until love coincides with sexuality, the stage of puberty,
with the repeated forming of woman, with the renewing of
sin? Woman is nothing but man&#8217;s expression and projection
of his own sexuality. Every man creates himself a
woman, in which he embodies himself and his own guilt.</p>

<p>But woman is not herself guilty; she is made so by the
guilt of others, and everything for which woman is blamed
should be laid at man&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>Love strives to cover guilt, instead of conquering it; it
elevates woman instead of nullifying her. The &#8220;something&#8221;
folds the &#8220;nothing&#8221; in its arms, and thinks thus to free the
universe of negation and drown all objections; whereas
the nothing would only disappear if the something put it
away.</p>

<p>Since man&#8217;s hatred for woman is not conscious hatred of
his own sexuality, his love is his most intense effort to save
woman as woman, instead of desiring to nullify her in
himself. And the consciousness of guilt comes from the
fact that the object of guilt is coveted instead of being
annihilated.</p>

<p>Woman alone, then, is guilt; and is so through man&#8217;s
fault. And if femaleness signifies pairing, it is only because
all guilt endeavours to increase its circle. What woman,
always unconsciously, accomplishes, she does because she
cannot help it; it is her reason for being, her whole nature.
She is only a part of man, his other, ineradicable, his lower
part. So matter appears to be as inexplicable a riddle as
form; woman as unending as man, negation as eternal as
existence; but this eternity is only the eternity of guilt.</p>

JUDAISM</h3>

<p>It would not be surprising if to many it should seem from
the foregoing arguments that &#8220;men&#8221; have come out of
them too well, and, as a collective body, have been placed
on an exaggeratedly lofty pedestal. The conclusions drawn
from these arguments, however surprised every Philistine
and young simpleton would be to learn that in himself he
comprises the whole world, cannot be opposed and confuted
by cheap reasoning; yet the treatment of the male
sex must not simply be considered too indulgent, or due
to a direct tendency to omit all the repulsive and small side
of manhood in order to favourably represent its best points.</p>

<p>The accusation would be unjustified. It does not enter
the author&#8217;s mind to idealise man in order more easily to
lower the estimation of woman. So much narrowness and
so much coarseness often thrive beneath the empirical
representation of manhood that it is a question of the better
possibilities lying in every man, neglected by him or perceived
either with painful clearness or dull animosity; possibilities
which as such in woman neither actually nor
meditatively ever come to any account. And here the
author cannot in any wise really rely on the dissimilarities
between men, however little he may impugn their importance.
It is, therefore, a question of establishing what
woman is not, and truly in her there is infinitely much wanting
which is never quite missing even in the most mediocre
and plebeian of men. That which is the positive attribute of
the woman, in so far as a positive can be spoken of in regard
to such a being, will constantly be found also in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
men. There are, as has already often been demonstrated,
men who have become women or have remained women;
but there is no woman who has surpassed certain circumscribed,
not particularly elevated moral and intellectual
limits. And, therefore, I must again assert that the woman
of the highest standard is immeasurably beneath the man
of lowest standard.</p>

<p>These objections may go even further and touch a point
where the ignoring of theory must assuredly become reprehensible.
There are, to wit, nations and races whose men,
though they can in no wise be regarded as intermediate
forms of the sexes, are found to approach so slightly and
so rarely to the ideal of manhood as set forth in my argument,
that the principles, indeed the entire foundation on
which this work rests, would seem to be severely shaken
by their existence. What shall we make, for example, out
of the Chinese, with their feminine freedom from internal
cravings and their incapacity for every effort? One
might feel tempted to believe in the complete effeminacy
of the whole race. It can at least be no mere whim of the
entire nation that the Chinaman habitually wears a pigtail,
and that the growth of his beard is of the very thinnest.
But how does the matter stand with the negroes? A genius
has perhaps scarcely ever appeared amongst the negroes,
and the standard of their morality is almost universally so
low that it is beginning to be acknowledged in America
that their emancipation was an act of imprudence.</p>

<p>If, consequently, the principle of the intermediate forms
of the sexes may perhaps enjoy a prospect of becoming of
importance to racial anthropology (since in some peoples
a greater share of womanishness would seem to be generally
disseminated), it must yet be conceded that the foregoing
deductions refer above all to Aryan men and Aryan women.
In how far, in the other great races of mankind, uniformity
with the standard of the Aryan race may reign, or what has
prevented and hindered this; to arrive more nearly at such
knowledge would require in the first instance the most
intense research into racial characteristics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span></p>

<p>The Jewish race, which has been chosen by me as a subject
of discussion, because, as will be shown, it presents
the gravest and most formidable difficulties for my views,
appears to possess a certain anthropological relationship
with both negroes and Mongolians. The readily curling
hair points to the negro; admixture of Mongolian blood
is suggested by the perfectly Chinese or Malay formation of
face and skull which is so often to be met with amongst
the Jews and which is associated with a yellowish complexion.
This is nothing more than the result of everyday
experience, and these remarks must not be otherwise
understood; the anthropological question of the origin
of the Jewish race is apparently insoluble, and even such
an interesting answer to it as that given by H. S. Chamberlain
has recently met with much opposition. The author
does not possess the knowledge necessary to treat of this;
what will be here briefly, but as far as possible profoundly
analysed, is the psychical peculiarity of the Jewish race.</p>

<p>This is an obligatory task imposed by psychological
observation and analysis. It is undertaken independently
of past history, the details of which must be uncertain.
The Jewish race offers a problem of the deepest significance
for the study of all races, and in itself it is intimately
bound up with many of the most troublesome problems of
the day.</p>

<p>I must, however, make clear what I mean by Judaism; I
mean neither a race nor a people nor a recognised creed.
I think of it as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological
constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but
which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion
only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm
my point of view.</p>

<p>The purest Aryans by descent and disposition are seldom
Antisemites, although they are often unpleasantly moved by
some of the peculiar Jewish traits; they cannot in the least
understand the Antisemite movement, and are, in consequence
of their defence of the Jews, often called Philosemites;
and yet these persons writing on the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
the hatred of Jews, have been guilty of the most profound
misunderstanding of the Jewish character. The aggressive
Antisemites, on the other hand, nearly always display certain
Jewish characters, sometimes apparent in their faces, although
they may have no real admixture of Jewish blood.<a id="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote25"><a href="#FNanchor25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a>
Zola was a typical case of a person absolutely without trace of
the Jewish qualities, and, therefore, a philosemite. The greatest
geniuses, on the other hand, have nearly always been antisemites
(Tacitus, Pascal, Voltaire, Herder, Goethe, Kant, Jean Paul,
Schopenhauer, Grillparzer, Wagner); this comes about from the
fact as geniuses they have something of everything in their natures,
and so can understand Judaism.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The explanation is simple. People love in others the
qualities they would like to have but do not actually have in
any great degree; so also we hate in others only what we
do not wish to be, and what notwithstanding we are partly.
We hate only qualities to which we approximate, but which
we realise first in other persons.</p>

<p>Thus the fact is explained that the bitterest Antisemites
are to be found amongst the Jews themselves. For only
the quite Jewish Jews, like the completely Aryan Aryans, are
not at all Antisemitically disposed; among the remainder
only the commoner natures are actively Antisemitic and
pass sentence on others without having once sat in judgment
on themselves in these matters; and very few exercise
their Antisemitism first on themselves. This one thing,
however, remains none the less certain: whoever detests
the Jewish disposition detests it first of all in himself; that
he should persecute it in others is merely his endeavour to
separate himself in this way from Jewishness; he strives to
shake it off and to localise it in his fellow-creatures, and so
for a moment to dream himself free of it. Hatred, like
love, is a projected phenomenon; that person alone is hated
who reminds one unpleasantly of oneself.</p>

<p>The Antisemitism of the Jews bears testimony to the
fact that no one who has had experience of them considers
them loveable&mdash;not even the Jew himself; the Antisemitism
of the Aryans grants us an insight no less full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
significance: it is that the Jew and the Jewish race must
not be confounded. There are Aryans who are more Jewish
than Jews, and real Jews who are more Aryan than certain
Aryans. I need not enumerate those non-semites who had
much Jewishness in them, the lesser (like the well-known
Frederick Nicolai of the eighteenth century) nor those of
moderate greatness (here Frederick Schiller can scarcely
be omitted), nor will I analyse their Jewishness. Above all
Richard Wagner&mdash;the bitterest Antisemite&mdash;cannot be held
free from an accretion of Jewishness even in his art, however
little one be misled by the feeling which sees in him
the greatest artist enshrined in historical humanity; and
this, though indubitably his Siegfried is the most un-Jewish
type imaginable. As Wagner&#8217;s aversion to grand
opera and the stage really led to the strongest attraction, an
attraction of which he was himself conscious, so his music,
which, in the unique simplicity of its motifs, is the most
powerful in the world, cannot be declared free from obtrusiveness,
loudness, and lack of distinction; from some consciousness
of this Wagner tried to gain coherence by the
extreme instrumentation of his works. It cannot be denied
(there can be no mistake about it) that Wagner&#8217;s music
produces the deepest impression not only on Jewish Antisemites,
who have never completely shaken off Jewishness,
but also on Indo-Germanic Antisemites. From the music
of &#8220;Parsifal,&#8221; which to genuine Jews will ever remain as
unapproachable as its poetry, from the Pilgrim&#8217;s march
and the procession to Rome in &#8220;Tannh&auml;user,&#8221; and assuredly
from many another part, they turn away. Doubtless, also,
none but a German could make so clearly manifest the
very essence of the German race as Wagner has succeeded
in doing in the &#8220;Meistersingers of Nurnberg.&#8221; In Wagner
one thinks constantly of that side of his character which leans
towards Feuerbach, instead of towards Schopenhauer.
Here no narrow psychological depreciation of this great
man is intended. Judaism was to him the greatest help in
reaching a clearer understanding and assertion of the
extremes within him in his struggle to reach &#8220;Siegfried&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
&#8220;Parsifal,&#8221; and in giving to German nature the highest
means of expression which has probably ever been found in
the pages of history. Yet a greater than Wagner was obliged
to overcome the Jewishness within him before he found his
special vocation; and it is, as previously stated, perhaps its
great significance in the world&#8217;s history and the immense
merit of Judaism that it and nothing else, leads the Aryan
to a knowledge of himself and warns him against himself.
For this the Aryan has to thank the Jew that, through
him, he knows to guard against Judaism as a possibility
within himself. This example will sufficiently illustrate what,
in my estimation, is to be understood by Judaism.</p>

<p>I do not refer to a nation or to a race, to a creed or to a
scripture. When I speak of the Jew I mean neither an
individual nor the whole body, but mankind in general, in
so far as it has a share in the platonic idea of Judaism.
My purpose is to analyse this idea.</p>

<p>That these researches should be included in a work
devoted to the characterology of the sexes may seem an
undue extension of my subject. But some reflection will
lead to the surprising result that Judaism is saturated with
femininity, with precisely those qualities the essence of
which I have shown to be in the strongest opposition to the
male nature. It would not be difficult to make a case for
the view that the Jew is more saturated with femininity
than the Aryan, to such an extent that the most manly Jew
is more feminine than the least manly Aryan.</p>

<p>This interpretation would be erroneous. It is most
important to lay stress on the agreements and differences
simply because so many points that become obvious in
dissecting woman reappear in the Jew.</p>

<p>Let me begin with the analogies. It is notable that the
Jews, even now when at least a relative security of tenure is
possible, prefer moveable property, and, in spite of their
acquisitiveness, have little real sense of personal property,
especially in its most characteristic form, landed property.
Property is indissolubly connected with the self, with
individuality. It is in harmony with the foregoing that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
Jew is so readily disposed to communism. Communism
must be distinguished clearly from socialism, the former
being based on a community of goods, an absence of
individual property, the latter meaning, in the first place a
co-operation of individual with individual, of worker with
worker, and a recognition of human individuality in every
one. Socialism is Aryan (Owen, Carlyle, Ruskin, Fichte).
Communism is Jewish (Marx). Modern social democracy
has moved far apart from the earlier socialism, precisely
because Jews have taken so large a share in developing it.
In spite of the associative element in it, the Marxian
doctrine does not lead in any way towards the State as a
union of all the separate individual aims, as the higher unit
combining the purposes of the lower units. Such a conception
is as foreign to the Jew as it is to the woman.</p>

<p>For these reasons Zionism must remain an impracticable
ideal, notwithstanding the fashion in which it has brought
together some of the noblest qualities of the Jews. Zionism
is the negation of Judaism, for the conception of Judaism
involves a world-wide distribution of the Jews. Citizenship
is an un-Jewish thing, and there has never been and never
will be a true Jewish State. The State involves the aggregation
of individual aims, the formation of and obedience to
self-imposed laws; and the symbol of the State, if nothing
more, is its head chosen by free election. The opposite
conception is that of anarchy, with which present-day
communism is closely allied. The ideal State has never
been historically realised, but in every case there is at least
a minimum of this higher unit, this conception of an ideal
power which distinguishes the State from the mere collection
of human beings in barracks. Rousseau&#8217;s much-despised
theory of the conscious co-operation of individuals
to form a State deserves more attention than it now receives.
Some ethical notion of free combination must always be
included.</p>

<p>The true conception of the State is foreign to the Jew,
because he, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his
failure to grasp the idea of true society is due to his lack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
a free intelligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere
together, but they do not associate as free independent
individuals mutually respecting each other&#8217;s individuality.</p>

<p>As there is no real dignity in women, so what is meant
by the word &#8220;gentleman&#8221; does not exist amongst the Jews.
The genuine Jew fails in this innate good breeding by
which alone individuals honour their own individuality and
respect that of others. There is no Jewish nobility, and
this is the more surprising as Jewish pedigrees can be traced
back for thousands of years.</p>

<p>The familiar Jewish arrogance has a similar explanation;
it springs from want of true knowledge of himself and the
consequent overpowering need he feels to enhance his own
personality by depreciating that of his fellow-creatures.
And so, although his descent is incomparably longer than
that of the members of Aryan aristocracies, he has an
inordinate love for titles. The Aryan respect for his
ancestors is rooted in the conception that they were <i>his</i>
ancestors; it depends on his valuation of his own personality,
and, in spite of the communistic strength and antiquity
of the Jewish traditions, this individual sense of ancestry is
lacking.</p>

<p>The faults of the Jewish race have often been attributed
to the repression of that race by Aryans, and many Christians
are still disposed to blame themselves in this respect.
But the self-reproach is not justified. Outward circumstances
do not mould a race in one direction, unless there
is in the race the innate tendency to respond to the
moulding forces; the total result comes at least as much
from the natural disposition as from the modifying circumstances.
We know now that the proof of the inheritance
of acquired characters has broken down, and, in the human
race still more than the lower forms of life, it is certain that
individual and racial characters persist in spite of all
adaptive moulding. When men change, it is from within,
outwards, unless the change, as in the case of women, is a
mere superficial imitation of real change, and is not rooted
in their natures. And how can we reconcile the idea that<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
the Jewish character is a modern modification with the
history of the foundation of the race, given in the Old
Testament without any disapprobation of how the patriarch
Jacob deceived his dying father, cheated his brother Esau
and over-reached his father-in-law, Laban?</p>

<p>The defenders of the Jew have rightly acquitted him of
any tendency to heinous crimes, and the legal statistics of
different countries confirm this. The Jew is not really
anti-moral. But, none the less, he does not represent the
highest ethical type. He is rather non-moral, neither very
good nor very bad, with nothing in him of either the angel
or the devil. Notwithstanding the Book of Job and the
story of Eden, it is plain that the conceptions of a Supreme
Good and a Supreme Evil are not truly Jewish; I have
no wish to enter upon the lengthy and controversial topics
of Biblical criticism, but at the least I shall be on sure
ground when I say that these conceptions play the least
significant part in modern Jewish life. Orthodox or unorthodox,
the modern Jew does not concern himself with
God and the Devil, with Heaven and Hell. If he does not
reach the heights of the Aryan, he is also less inclined to
commit murder or other crimes of violence.</p>

<p>So also in the case of the woman; it is easier for her
defenders to point to the infrequency of her commission of
serious crimes than to prove her intrinsic morality. The
homology of Jew and woman becomes closer the further
examination goes. There is no female devil, and no female
angel; only love, with its blind aversion from actuality,
sees in woman a heavenly nature, and only hate sees in her
a prodigy of wickedness. Greatness is absent from the
nature of the woman and the Jew, the greatness of morality,
or the greatness of evil. In the Aryan man, the good and
bad principles of Kant&#8217;s religious philosophy are ever present,
ever in strife. In the Jew and the woman, good and
evil are not distinct from one another.</p>

<p>Jews, then, do not live as free, self-governing individuals,
choosing between virtue and vice in the Aryan fashion.
They are a mere collection of similar individuals each cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
in the same mould, the whole forming as it were a continuous
plasmodium. The Antisemite has often thought of
this as a defensive and aggressive union, and has formulated
the conception of a Jewish &#8220;solidarity.&#8221; There is a deep
confusion here. When some accusation is made against
some unknown member of the Jewish race, all Jews secretly
take the part of the accused, and wish, hope for, and seek
to establish his innocence. But it must not be thought
that they are interesting themselves more in the fate of the
individual Jew than they would do in the case of an individual
Christian. It is the menace to Judaism in general,
the fear that the shameful shadow may do harm to Judaism
as a whole, which is the origin of the apparent feeling of
sympathy. In the same way, women are delighted when a
member of their sex is depreciated, and will themselves
assist, until the proceeding seems to throw a disadvantageous
light over the sex in general, so frightening men
from marriage. The race or sex alone is defended, not the
individual.</p>

<p>It would be easy to understand why the family (in its
biological not its legal sense) plays a larger <i>r&ocirc;le</i> amongst
the Jews than amongst any other people; the English,
who in certain ways are akin to the Jews, coming next.
The family, in this biological sense, is feminine and maternal
in its origin, and has no relation to the State or to society.
The fusion, the continuity of the members of the family,
reaches its highest point amongst the Jews. In the Indo-Germanic
races, especially in the case of the more gifted,
but also in quite ordinary individuals, there is never complete
harmony between father and son; consciously, or
unconsciously, there is always in the mind of the son a certain
feeling of impatience against the man who, unasked,
brought him into the world, gave him a name, and determined
his limitations in this earthly life. It is only amongst
the Jews that the son feels deeply rooted in the family and
is fully at one with his father. It scarcely ever happens
amongst Christians that father and son are really friends.
Amongst Christians even the daughters stand a little further<span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
apart from the family circle than happens with Jewesses,
and more frequently take up some calling which isolates
them and gives them independent interests.</p>

<p>We reach at this point a fact in relation to the argument
of the last chapter. I showed there that the essential
element in the pairing instinct was an indistinct sense of
individuality and of the limits between individuals. Men
who are match-makers have always a Jewish element in
them. The Jew is always more absorbed by sexual matters
than the Aryan, although he is notably less potent sexually
and less liable to be enmeshed in a great passion. The Jews
are habitual match-makers, and in no race does it so often
happen that marriages are arranged by men. This kind of
activity is certainly peculiarly necessary in their case, for, as
I have already stated, there is no people amongst which
marriages for love are so rare. The organic disposition of
the Jews towards match-making is associated with their
racial failure to comprehend asceticism. It is interesting to
note that the Jewish Rabbis have always been addicted to
speculations as to the begetting of children and have a rich
tradition on the subject, a natural result in the case of the
people who invented the phrase as to the duty of &#8220;multiplying
and replenishing the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pairing instinct is the great remover of the limits
between individuals; and the Jew, <i>par excellence</i>, is the
breaker down of such limits. He is at the opposite pole
from aristocrats, with whom the preservation of the limits
between individuals is the leading idea. The Jew is an
inborn communist. The Jew&#8217;s careless manners in society
and his want of social tact turn on this quality, for the
reserves of social intercourse are simply barriers to protect
individuality.</p>

<p>I desire at this point again to lay stress on the fact,
although it should be self-evident, that, in spite of my low
estimate of the Jew, nothing could be further from my
intention than to lend the faintest support to any practical
or theoretical persecution of Jews. I am dealing with
Judaism, in the platonic sense, as an idea. There is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span>
more an absolute Jew than an absolute Christian. I am not
speaking against the individual, whom, indeed, if that had
been so, I should have wounded grossly and unnecessarily.
Watchwords, such as &#8220;Buy only from Christians,&#8221; have
in reality a Jewish taint; they have a meaning only for those
who regard the race and not the individual, and what is to
be compared with them is the Jewish use of the word &#8220;Goy,&#8221;
which is now almost obsolete. I have no wish to boycott
the Jew, or by any such immoral means to attempt to solve
the Jewish question. Nor will Zionism solve that question;
as H. S. Chamberlain has pointed out, since the destruction
of the Temple at Jerusalem, Judaism has ceased to be
national, and has become a spreading parasite, straggling
all over the earth and finding true root nowhere. Before
Zionism is possible, the Jew must first conquer Judaism.</p>

<p>To defeat Judaism, the Jew must first understand himself,
and war against himself. So far, the Jew has reached no
further than to make and enjoy jokes against his own peculiarities.
Unconsciously he respects the Aryan more than
himself. Only steady resolution, united to the highest self-respect,
can free the Jew from Jewishness. This resolution,
be it ever so strong, ever so honourable, can only be understood
and carried out by the individual, not by the group.
Therefore the Jewish question can only be solved individually;
every single Jew must try to solve it in his proper
person.</p>

<p>There is no other solution to the question and can be no
other; Zionism will never succeed in answering it.</p>

<p>The Jew, indeed, who has overcome, the Jew who has
become a Christian, has the fullest right to be regarded by
the Aryan in his individual capacity, and no longer be condemned
as belonging to a race above which his moral
efforts have raised him. He may rest assured that no
one will dispute his well-founded claim. The Aryan of
good social standing always feels the need to respect the
Jew; his Antisemitism being no joy, no amusement to him.
Therefore he is displeased when Jews make revelations
about Jews, and he who does so may expect as few thanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span>
from that quarter as from over-sensitive Judaism itself.
Above all, the Aryan desires that the Jew should justify
Antisemitism by being baptized. But the danger of this
outward acknowledgment of his inward struggles need not
trouble the Jew who wishes for liberty within him. He
will long to reach the holy baptism of the Spirit, of which
that of the body is but the outward symbol.</p>

<p>To reach so important and useful a result as what
Jewishness and Judaism really are, would be to solve
one of the most difficult problems; Judaism is a much
deeper riddle than the many Antisemites believe, and in
very truth a certain darkness will always enshroud it. Even
the parallel with woman will soon fail us, though now and
then it may help us further.</p>

<p>In Christians pride and humility, in Jews haughtiness
and cringing, are ever at strife; in the former self-consciousness
and contrition, in the latter arrogance and
bigotry. In the total lack of humility of the Jew lies his
failure to grasp the idea of grace. From his slavish disposition
springs his heteronomous code of ethics, the
&#8220;Decalogue,&#8221; the most immoral book of laws in the universe,
which enjoins on obedient followers, submission to
the powerful will of an exterior influence, with the reward
of earthly well-being and the conquest of the world. His
relations with Jehovah, the abstract Deity, whom he slavishly
fears, whose name he never dares to pronounce, characterise
the Jew; he, like the woman, requires the rule of an
exterior authority. According to the definition of Schopenhauer,
the word &#8216;God&#8217; indicates a man who made
the world. This certainly is a true likeness of the God of
the Jew. Of the divine in man, of &#8220;the God who in my
bosom dwells,&#8221; the true Jew knows nothing; for what
Christ and Plato, Eckhard and Paul, Goethe and Kant, the
priests of the Vedas, Fechner, and every Aryan have meant
by divine, for what the saying, &#8220;I am with you always even
to the end of the world&#8221;&mdash;for the meaning of all these the
Jew remains without understanding. For the God in man
is the human soul, and the absolute Jew is devoid of a soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span></p>

<p>It is inevitable, then, that we should find no trace of
belief in immortality in the Old Testament. Those who
have no soul can have no craving for immortality, and so
it is with the woman and the Jew; &#8220;Anima naturaliter
Christiana,&#8221; said Tertullian.</p>

<p>The absence from the Jew of true mysticism&mdash;Chamberlain
has remarked on this&mdash;has a similar origin. They
have nothing but the grossest superstition and the system of
divinatory magic known as the &#8220;Kabbala.&#8221; Jewish monotheism
has no relation to a true belief in God; it is not
a religion of reason, but a belief of old women founded
on fear.</p>

<p>Why is it that the Jewish slave of Jehovah should become
so readily a materialist or a freethinker? It is merely the
alternative phase to slavery; arrogance about what is not
understood is the other side of the slavish intelligence.
When it is fully recognised that Judaism is to be regarded
rather as an idea in which other races have a share, than as
the absolute property of a particular race, then the Judaic
element in modern materialistic science will be better
understood. Wagner has given expression to Judaism in
music; there remains to say something about Judaism in
modern science.</p>

<p>Judaism in science, in the widest interpretation of it, is
the endeavour to remove all transcendentalism. The Aryan
feels that the effort to grasp everything, and to refer everything
to some system of deductions, really robs things of
their true meaning; for him, what cannot be discovered is
what gives the world its significance. The Jew has no fear
of these hidden and secret elements, for he has no consciousness
of their presence. He tries to take a view of the
world as flat and commonplace as possible, and to refuse to
see all the secret and spiritual meanings of things. His
view is non-philosophical rather than anti-philosophical.</p>

<p>Because fear of God in the Jew has no relation with real
religion, the Jew is of all persons the least perturbed by
mechanical, materialistic theories of the world; he is readily
beguiled by Darwinism and the ridiculous notion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
men are derived from monkeys; and now he is disposed
to accept the view that the soul of man is an evolution that
has taken place within the human race; formerly, he was a
mad devotee of Buchner, now he is ready to follow Ostwald.</p>

<p>It is due to a real disposition that the Jews should be so
prominent in the study of chemistry; they cling naturally
to matter, and expect to find the solution of everything in
its properties. And yet one who was the greatest German
investigator of all times, Kepler himself, wrote the following
hexameter on chemistry:</p>

<p>The present turn of medical science is largely due to the
influence of the Jews, who in such numbers have embraced
the medical profession. From the earliest times, until the
dominance of the Jews, medicine was closely allied with
religion. But now they would make it a matter of drugs, a
mere administration of chemicals. But it can never be that
the organic will be explained by the inorganic. Fechner and
Preyer were right when they said that death came from
life, not life from death. We see this taking place daily in
individuals (in human beings, for instance, old age prepares
for death by a calcification of the tissues). And as
yet no one has seen the organic arise from the inorganic.
From the time of Schwammerdam to that of Pasteur it has
become more and more certain that living things never
arise from what is not alive. Surely this ontogenetic observation
should be applied to phylogeny, and we should be
equally certain that, in the past, the dead arose from the
living. The chemical interpretation of organisms sets these
on a level with their own dead ashes. We should return
from this Judaistic science to the nobler conceptions of
Copernicus and Galileo, Kepler and Euler, Newton and
Linn&aelig;us, Lamarck and Faraday, Sprengel and Cuvier. The
freethinkers of to-day, soulless and not believing in the
soul, are incapable of filling the places of these great men
and of reverently realising the presence of intrinsic secrets
in nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page316">[316]</span></p>

<p>It is this want of depth which explains the absence of
truly great Jews; like women, they are without any trace
of genius. The philosopher Spinoza, about whose purely
Jewish descent there can be no doubt, is incomparably the
greatest Jew of the last nine hundred years, much greater
than the poet Heine (who, indeed, was almost destitute of
any quality of true greatness) or than that original, if
shallow painter, Israels. The extraordinary fashion in
which Spinoza has been over-estimated is less due to his
intrinsic merit than to the fortuitous circumstance that he
was the only thinker to whom Goethe gave his attention.</p>

<p>For Spinoza himself there was no deep problem in
nature (and in this he showed his Jewish character), as,
otherwise, he would not have elaborated his mathematical
method, a method according to which the explanation of
things was to be found in themselves. This system formed
a refuge into which Spinoza could escape from himself, and
it is not unnatural that it should have been attractive to
Goethe, who was the most introspective of men, as it might
have seemed to offer to him tranquillity and rest.</p>

<p>Spinoza showed his Jewishness and the limits that always
confine the Jewish spirit in a still plainer fashion; I am not
thinking of his failure to comprehend the State or of his
adhesion to the Hobbesian doctrine of universal warfare
as the primitive condition of mankind. The matter goes
deeper. I have in mind his complete rejection of free-will&mdash;the
Jew is always a slave and a determinist&mdash;and his
view that individuals were mere accidents into which the
universal substance had fallen. The Jew is never a believer in
monads. And so there is no wider philosophical gulf than
that between Spinoza and his much more eminent contemporary,
Leibnitz, the protagonist of the monad theory,
or its still greater creator, Bruno, whose superficial likeness
with Spinoza has been exaggerated in the most grotesque
fashion.</p>

<p>Just as Jews and women are without extreme good and
extreme evil, so they never show either genius or the depth
of stupidity of which mankind is capable. The specific<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
kind of intelligence for which Jews and women alike are
notorious is due simply to the alertness of an exaggerated
egotism; it is due, moreover, to the boundless capacity
shown by both for pursuing any object with equal zeal,
because they have no intrinsic standard of value&mdash;nothing
in their own souls by which to judge of the worthiness
of any particular object. And so they have unhampered
natural instincts, such as are not present to help the Aryan
man when his transcendental standard fails him.</p>

<p>I may now touch upon the likeness of the English to the
Jews, a topic discussed at length by Wagner. It cannot be
doubted that of the Germanic races the English are in
closest relationship with the Jews. Their orthodoxy and
their devotion to the Sabbath afford a direct indication.
The religion of the Englishman is always tinged with hypocrisy,
and his asceticism is largely prudery. The English,
like women, have been most unproductive in religion and
in music; there may be irreligious poets, although not
great artists, but there is no irreligious musician. So, also,
the English have produced no great architects or philosophers.
Berkeley, like Swift and Sterne, were Irish; Carlyle,
Hamilton, and Burns were Scotch. Shakespeare and
Shelley, the two greatest Englishmen, stand far from the
pinnacle of humanity; they do not reach so far as Angelo
and Beethoven. If we consider English philosophers we
shall see that there has been a great degeneration since the
Middle Ages. It began with William of Ockham and Duns
Scotus; it proceeded through Roger Bacon and his namesake,
the Chancellor; through Hobbes, who, mentally, was
so near akin to Spinoza; through the superficial Locke to
Hartley, Priestley, Bentham, the two Mills, Lewes, Huxley,
and Spencer. These are the greatest names in the history
of English philosophy, for Adam Smith and David Hume
were Scotchmen. It must always be remembered against
England, that from her there came the soulless psychology.
The Englishman has impressed himself on the German as a
rigorous empiricist and as a practical politician, but these
two sides exhaust his importance in philosophy. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
has never yet been a true philosopher who made empiricism
his basis, and no Englishman has got beyond empiricism
without external help.</p>

<p>None the less, the Englishman must not be confused with
the Jew. There is more of the transcendental element in
him, and his mind is directed rather from the transcendental
to the practical, than from the practical towards the transcendental.
Otherwise he would not be so readily disposed
to humour, unlike the Jew, who is ready to be witty only at
his own expense or on sexual things.</p>

<p>I am well aware how difficult are the problems of laughter
and humour&mdash;just as difficult as any problems that are
peculiar to man and not shared by him with the beasts; so
difficult that neither Schopenhauer nor Jean Paul himself
were able to elucidate them. Humour has many aspects;
in some men it seems to be an expression of pity for themselves
or for others, but this element is not sufficient to
distinguish it.</p>

<p>The essence of humour appears to me to consist in a
laying of stress on empirical things, in order that their
unreality may become more obvious. Everything that is
realised is laughable, and in this way humour seems to be
the antithesis of eroticism. The latter welds men and the
world together, and unites them in a great purpose; the
former loses the bonds of synthesis and shows the world as
a silly affair. The two stand somewhat in the relation of
polarised and unpolarised light.</p>

<p>When the great erotic wishes to pass from the limited to
the illimited, humour pounces down on him, pushes him
in front of the stage, and laughs at him from the wings.
The humourist has not the craving to transcend space; he
is content with small things; his dominion is neither the
sea nor the mountains, but the flat level plain. He shuns
the idyllic, and plunges deeply into the commonplace,
only, however, to show its unreality. He turns from the
immanence of things and will not hear the transcendental
even spoken of. Wit seeks out contradictions in the sphere of
experience; humour goes deeper and shows that experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
is a blind and closed system; both compromise the phenomenal
world by showing that everything is possible in it.
Tragedy, on the other hand, shows what must for all
eternity be impossible in the phenomenal world; and thus
tragedy and comedy alike, each in their own way, are
negations of the empiric.</p>

<p>The Jew who does not set out, like the humourist, from
the transcendental, and does not move towards it, like the
erotic, has no interest in depreciating what is called the
actual world, and that never becomes for him the paraphernalia
of a juggler or the nightmare of a mad-house.
Humour, because it recognises the transcendental, if only
by the mode of resolutely concealing it, is essentially
tolerant; satire, on the other hand, is essentially intolerant,
and is congruous with the disposition of the Jew and the
woman. Jews and women are devoid of humour, but
addicted to mockery. In Rome there was even a woman
(Sulpicia) who wrote satires. Satire, because of its intolerance,
is impossible to men in society. The humourist, who
knows how to keep the trifles and littlenesses of phenomena
from troubling himself or others, is a welcome guest.
Humour, like love, moves away obstacles from our path;
it makes possible a way of regarding the world. The Jew,
therefore, is least addicted to society, and the Englishman
most adapted for it.</p>

<p>The comparison of the Jew with the Englishman fades
out much more quickly than that with the woman. Both
comparisons first arose in the heat of the conflict as to the
worth and the nature of Jews. I may again refer to Wagner,
who not only interested himself deeply in the problem of
Judaism, but rediscovered the Jew in the Englishman, and
threw the shadow of Ahasuerus over his Kundry, probably
the most perfect representation of woman in art.</p>

<p>The fact that no woman in the world represents the idea
of the wife so completely as the Jewess (and not only in the
eyes of Jews) still further supports the comparison between
Jews and women. In the case of the Aryans, the metaphysical
qualities of the male are part of his sexual attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
for the woman, and so, in a fashion, she puts on an appearance
of these. The Jew, on the other hand, has no transcendental
quality, and in the shaping and moulding of the
wife leaves the natural tendencies of the female nature a
more unhampered sphere; and the Jewish woman, accordingly,
plays the part required of her, as house-mother or
odalisque, as Cybele or Cyprian, in the fullest way.</p>

<p>The congruity between Jews and women further reveals
itself in the extreme adaptability of the Jews, in their great
talent for journalism, the &#8220;mobility&#8221; of their minds, their
lack of deeply-rooted and original ideas, in fact the mode
in which, like women, because they are nothing in themselves,
they can become everything. The Jew is an individual,
not an individuality; he is in constant close relation
with the lower life, and has no share in the higher metaphysical
life.</p>

<p>At this point the comparison between the Jew and the
woman breaks down; the being-nothing and becoming-all-things
differs in the two. The woman is material which
passively assumes any form impressed upon it. In the Jew
there is a definite aggressiveness; it is not because of the
great impression that others make on him that he is receptive;
he is no more subject to suggestion than the Aryan
man, but he adapts himself to every circumstance and every
race, becoming, like the parasite, a new creature in
every different host, although remaining essentially the
same. He assimilates himself to everything, and assimilates
everything; he is not dominated by others, but
submits himself to them. The Jew is gifted, the woman
is not gifted, and the giftedness of the Jew reveals itself in
many forms of activity, as, for instance, in jurisprudence;
but these activities are always relative and never seated in
the creative freedom of the will.</p>

<p>The Jew is as persistent as the woman, but his persistence
is not that of the individual but of the race. He is not
unconditioned like the Aryan, but his limitations differ from
those of the woman.</p>

<p>The true peculiarity of the Jew reveals itself best in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
essentially irreligious nature. I cannot here enter on a discussion
as to the idea of religion; but it is enough to say
that it is associated essentially with an acceptance of the
higher and eternal in man as different in kind, and in no
sense to be derived from the phenomenal life. The Jew is
eminently the unbeliever. Faith is that act of man by
which he enters into relation with being, and religious faith
is directed towards absolute, eternal being, the &#8220;life everlasting&#8221;
of the religious phrase. The Jew is really nothing
because he believes in nothing.</p>

<p>Belief is everything. It does not matter if a man does
not believe in God; let him believe in atheism. But the
Jew believes nothing; he does not believe his own belief;
he doubts as to his own doubt. He is never absorbed by
his own joy, or engrossed by his own sorrow. He never
takes himself in earnest, and so never takes any one else in
earnest. He is content to be a Jew, and accepts any disadvantages
that come from the fact.</p>

<p>We have now reached the fundamental difference between
the Jew and the woman. Neither believe in themselves; but
the woman believes in others, in her husband, her lover, or
her children, or in love itself; she has a centre of gravity,
although it is outside her own being. The Jew believes in
nothing, within him or without him. His want of desire
for permanent landed property and his attachment to
movable goods are more than symbolical.</p>

<p>The woman believes in the man, in the man outside her,
or in the man from whom she takes her inspiration, and
in this fashion can take herself in earnest. The Jew takes
nothing seriously; he is frivolous, and jests about anything,
about the Christian&#8217;s Christianity, the Jew&#8217;s baptism. He
is neither a true realist nor a true empiricist. Here I must
state certain limitations to my agreement with Chamberlain&#8217;s
conclusions. The Jew is not really a convinced
empiricist in the fashion of the English philosophers. The
empiricist believes in the possibility of reaching a complete
system of knowledge on an empirical basis; he hopes for
the perfection of science. The Jew does not really believe in<span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span>
knowledge, nor is he a sceptic, for he doubts his own scepticism.
On the other hand, a brooding care hovers over the
non-metaphysical system of Avenarius, and even in Ernst
Mach&#8217;s adherence to relativity there are signs of a deeply
reverent attitude. The empiricists must not be accused of
Judaism because they are shallow.</p>

<p>The Jew is the impious man in the widest sense. Piety
is not something near things nor outside things; it is the
groundwork of everything. The Jew has been incorrectly
called vulgar, simply because he does not concern himself
with metaphysics. All true culture that comes from within,
all that a man believes to be true and that so is true for
him, depend on reverence. Reverence is not limited to the
mystic or the religious man; all science and all scepticism,
everything that a man truly believes, have reverence as the
fundamental quality. Naturally it displays itself in different
ways, in high seriousness and sanctity, in earnestness
and enthusiasm. The Jew is never either enthusiastic or indifferent,
he is neither ecstatic nor cold. He reaches neither the
heights nor the depths. His restraint becomes meagreness,
his copiousness becomes bombast. Should he venture into
the boundless realms of inspired thought, he seldom
reaches beyond pathos. And although he cannot embrace
the whole world, he is for ever covetous of it.</p>

<p>Discrimination and generalisation, strength and love,
science and poetry, every real and deep emotion of the
human heart, have reverence as their essential basis. It is
not necessary that faith, as in men of genius, should be in
relation only to metaphysical entity; it can extend also to
the empirical world and appear fully there, and yet none
the less be faith in oneself, in worth, in truth, in the absolute,
in God.</p>

<p>As the comprehensive view of religion and piety that I
have given may lead to misconstruction, I propose to elucidate
it further. True piety is not merely the possession of
piety, but also the struggle to possess it; it is found equally
in the convinced believer in God (Handel or Fechner), and
also in the doubting seeker (Lenau and D&uuml;rer); it need not<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>
be made obvious to the world (as in the case of Bach), it
may display itself only in a reverent attitude (Mozart). Nor
is piety necessarily connected with the appearance of a
Founder; the ancient Greeks were the most reverent people
that have lived, and hence their culture was highest; but
their religion had no personal Founder.</p>

<p>Religion is the creation of the all; and all that humanity
can be is only through religion. So far from the Jew being
religious, as has been assumed, he is profoundly irreligious.</p>

<p>Were there need to elaborate my verdict on the Jews I
might point out that the Jews, alone of peoples, do not try
to make converts to their faith, and that when converts are
made they serve as objects of puzzled ridicule to them.
Need I refer to the meaningless formality and the repetitions
of Jewish prayer? Need I remind readers that the Jewish
religion is a mere historical tradition, a memorial of such
incidents as the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, with
the consequent thanks of cowards to their Saviour; and
that it is no guide to the meaning and conduct of life? The
Jew is truly irreligious and furthest of mankind from faith.
There is no relation between the Jew himself and the
universe; he has none of the heroism of faith, just as he
has none of the disaster of absolute unbelief.</p>

<p>It is not, then, mysticism that the Jew is without, as
Chamberlain maintains, but reverence. If he were only an
honest-minded materialist or a frank evolutionist! He is
not a critic, but only critical; he is not a sceptic in the
Cartesian sense, not a doubter who sets out from doubt
towards truth, but an ironist; as, for instance, to take a
conspicuous example, Heine.</p>

<p>What, then, is the Jew if he is nothing that a man can
be? What goes on within him if he is utterly without
finality, if there is no ground in him which the plumb line
of psychology may reach?</p>

<p>The psychological contents of the Jewish mind are always
double or multiple. There are always before him two
or many possibilities, where the Aryan, although he sees as
widely, feels himself limited in his choice. I think that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
idea of Judaism consists in this want of reality, this absence
of any fundamental relation to the thing-in-and-for-itself.
He stands, so to speak, outside reality, without ever entering
it. He can never make himself one with anything&mdash;never
enter into real relationships. He is a zealot without zeal;
he has no share in the unlimited, the unconditioned. He is
without simplicity of faith, and so is always turning to each
new interpretation, so seeming more alert than the Aryan.
Internal multiplicity is the essence of Judaism, internal
simplicity that of the Aryan.</p>

<p>It might be urged that the Jewish double-mindedness is
modern, and is the result of new knowledge struggling with
the old orthodoxy. The education of the Jew, however,
only accentuates his natural qualities, and the doubting
Jew turns with a renewed zeal to money-making, in which
only he can find his standard of value. A curious proof of
the absence of simplicity in the mind of the Jew is that he
seldom sings, not from bashfulness, but because he does not
believe in his own singing. Just as the acuteness of Jews
has nothing to do with true power of differentiating, so his
shyness about singing or even about speaking in clear
positive tones has nothing to do with real reserve. It is
a kind of inverted pride; having no true sense of his own
worth, he fears being made ridiculous by his singing or
speech. The embarrassment of the Jew extends to things
which have nothing to do with the real ego.</p>

<p>It has been seen how difficult it is to define the Jew. He
has neither severity nor tenderness. He is both tenacious
and weak. He is neither king nor leader, slave nor vassal.
He has no share in enthusiasm, and yet he has little
equanimity. Nothing is self-evident to him, and yet he is
astonished at nothing. He has no trace of Lohengrin in
him, and none of Telramund. He is ridiculous as a
member of a students&#8217; corps and he is equally ridiculous
as a &#8220;philister.&#8221; Because he believes in nothing, he takes
refuge in materialism; from this arises his avarice, which is
simply an attempt to convince himself that something has
a permanent value. And yet he is no real tradesman; what<span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span>
is unreal, insecure in German commerce, is the result of the
Jewish speculative interest.</p>

<p>The erotics of the Jew are sentimentalism, and their
humour is satire. Perhaps examples may help to explain
my interpretation of the Jewish character, and I point
readily to Ibsen&#8217;s King Hakon in the &#8220;Pretenders,&#8221; and to
his Dr. Stockmann in &#8220;The Enemy of the People.&#8221; These
may make clear what is for ever absent in the Jew. Judaism
and Christianity form the greatest possible contrasts; the
former is bereft of all true faith and of inner identity, the
latter is the highest expression of the highest faith. Christianity
is heroism at its highest point; Judaism is the extreme
of cowardliness.</p>

<p>Chamberlain has said much that is true and striking as to
the fearful awe-struck want of understanding that the Jew
displays with regard to the person and teaching of Christ,
for the combination of warrior and sufferer in Him, for His
life and death. None the less, it would be wrong to state
that the Jew is an enemy of Christ, that he represents the
anti-Christ; it is only that he feels no relation with Him.
It is strong-minded Aryans, malefactors, who hate Jesus.
The Jew does not get beyond being bewildered and
disturbed by Him, as something that passes his wit to
understand.</p>

<p>And yet it has stood the Jew in good stead that the New
Testament seemed the outcome and fine flower of the Old,
the fulfilment of its Messianic prophecies. The polar opposition
between Judaism and Christianity makes the origin of
the latter from the former a deep riddle; it is the riddle of
the psychology of the founder of religions.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the genius who founds a
religion and other kinds of genius? What is it that has led
him to found the religion?</p>

<p>The main difference is no other than that he did not
always believe in the God he worships. Tradition relates
of Buddha, as of Christ, that they were subject to greater
temptations than other men. Two others, Mahomet and
Luther, were epileptic. Epilepsy is the disease of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
criminal; C&aelig;sar, Narses, Napoleon, the greatest of the
criminals, were epileptics.</p>

<p>The founder of a religion is the man who has lived
without God and yet has struggled towards the greatest
faith. How is it possible for a bad man to transform himself?
As Kant, although he was compelled to admit the fact,
asked in his &#8220;Philosophy of Religion,&#8221; how can an evil tree
bring forth good fruit? The inconceivable mystery of the
transformation into a good man of one who has lived evilly
all the days and years of his life has actually realised itself
in the case of some six or seven historical personages.
These have been the founders of religions.</p>

<p>Other men of genius are good from their birth; the
religious founder acquires goodness. The old existence
ceases utterly and is replaced by the new. The greater the
man, the more must perish in him at the regeneration. I
am inclined to think that Socrates, alone amongst the
Greeks, approached closely to the founders of religion;
perhaps he made the decisive struggle with evil in the four-and-twenty
hours during which he stood alone at Potid&aelig;a.</p>

<p>The founder of a religion is the man for whom no problem
has been solved from his birth. He is the man with the
least possible sureness of conviction, for whom everything
is doubtful and uncertain, and who has to conquer everything
for himself in this life. One has to struggle against
illness and physical weakness, another trembles on the
brink of the crimes which are possible for him, yet another
has been in the bonds of sin from his birth. It is only a
formal statement to say that original sin is the same in all
persons; it differs materially for each person. Here one,
there another, each as he was born, has chosen what is
senseless and worthless, has preferred instinct to his will, or
pleasure to love; only the founder of a religion has had
original sin in its absolute form; in him everything is
doubtful, everything is in question. He has to meet every
problem and free himself from all guilt. He has to reach
firm ground from the deepest abyss; he has to surmount
the nothingness in him and bind himself to the utmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
reality. And so it may be said of him that he frees himself
of original sin, that in him God becomes man, but also
that the man becomes God; in him was all error and
all guilt; in him there comes to be all expiation and
redemption.</p>

<p>Thus the founder of a religion is the greatest of the
geniuses, for he has vanquished the most. He is the man
who has accomplished victoriously what the deepest
thinkers of mankind have thought of only timorously as
a possibility, the complete regeneration of a man, the
reversal of his will. Other great men of genius have,
indeed, to fight against evil, but the bent of their souls is
towards the good. The founder of a religion has so much
in him of evil, of the perverse, of earthly passion, that he
must fight with the enemy within him for forty days in the
wilderness, without food or sleep. It was only thus that he
can conquer and overcome the death within him and free
himself for the highest life. Were it otherwise there would
be no impulse to found a faith. The founder of a religion
is thus the very antipodes of the emperor; emperor and
Galilean are at the two poles of thought. In Napoleon&#8217;s
life, also, there was a moment when a conversion took
place; but this was not a turning away from earthly life, but
the deliberate decision for the treasure and power and
splendour of the earthly life. Napoleon was great in the
colossal intensity with which he flung from him all the
ideal, all relation to the absolute, in the magnitude of his
guilt. The founder of religion, on the other hand, cannot
and will not bring to man anything except that which was
most difficult for himself to attain, the reconciliation with
God. He knows that he himself was the man most laden
with guilt, and he atones for the guilt by his death on the
cross.</p>

<p>There were two possibilities in Judaism. Before the
birth of Christ, these two, negation and affirmation, were
together awaiting choice. Christ was the man who conquered
in Himself Judaism, the greatest negation, and
created Christianity, the strongest affirmation and the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
direct opposite of Judaism. Now the choice has been
made; the old Israel has divided into Jews and Christians,
and Judaism has lost the possibility of producing greatness.
The new Judaism has been unable to produce men like
Samson and Joshua, the least Jewish of the old Jews. In
the history of the world, Christendom and Jewry represent
negation and affirmation. In old Israel there was the
highest possibility of mankind, the possibility of Christ.
The other possibility is the Jew.</p>

<p>I must guard against misconception; I do not mean that
there was any approach to Christianity in Judaism; the one
is the absolute negation of the other; the relation between
the two is only that which exists between all pairs of direct
opposites. Even more than in the case of piety and Judaism,
Judaism and Christianity can best be contrasted by what
each respectively excludes. Nothing is easier than to be
Jewish, nothing so difficult as to be Christian. Judaism is
the abyss over which Christianity is erected, and for that
reason the Aryan dreads nothing so deeply as the Jew.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to believe, with Chamberlain, that the
birth of the Saviour in Palestine was an accident. Christ
was a Jew, precisely that He might overcome the Judaism
within Him, for he who triumphs over the deepest doubt
reaches the highest faith; he who has raised himself above
the most desolate negation is most sure in his position of
affirmation. Judaism was the peculiar, original sin of
Christ; it was His victory over Judaism that made Him
greater than Buddha or Confucius. Christ was the greatest
man because He conquered the greatest enemy. Perhaps
He was, and will remain, the only Jew to conquer Judaism.
The first of the Jews to become wholly the Christ was also
the last who made the transition. It may be, however, that
there still lies in Judaism the possibility of producing
a Christ, and that the founder of the next religion will pass
through Jewry.</p>

<p>On no other supposition can we account for the long
persistence of the Jewish race which has outlived so many
other peoples. Without at least some vague hope, the Jews<span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span>
could not have survived, and the hope is that there must be
something in Judaism for Judaism; it is the idea of a Messiah,
of one who shall save them from Judaism. Every
other race has had some special watchword, and, on realising
their watchword, they have perished. The Jews have
failed to realise their watchword, and so their vitality persists.
The Jewish nature has no other metaphysical meaning
than to be the spring from which the founders of
religion will come. Their tradition to increase and multiply
is connected with this vague hope, that out of them shall
come the Messiah. The possibility of begetting Christs is
the meaning of Judaism.</p>

<p>As in the Jew there are the greatest possibilities, so also
in him are the meanest actualities; he is adapted to most
things and realises fewest.</p>

<p>Judaism, at the present day, has reached its highest point
since the time of Herod. Judaism is the spirit of modern
life. Sexuality is accepted, and contemporary ethics sing
the praises of pairing. Unhappy Nietzsche must not be
made responsible for the shameful doctrines of Wilhelm
B&ouml;lsche. Nietzsche himself understood asceticism, and
perhaps it was only as a revulsion from the evils of his own
asceticism that he attached value to the opposite conception.
It is the Jew and the woman who are the apostles of
pairing to bring guilt on humanity.</p>

<p>Our age is not only the most Jewish but the most feminine.
It is a time when art is content with daubs and seeks its
inspiration in the sports of animals; the time of a superficial
anarchy, with no feeling for Justice and the State; a time
of communistic ethics, of the most foolish of historical
views, the materialistic interpretation of history; a time of
capitalism and of Marxism; a time when history, life, and
science are no more than political economy and technical
instruction; a time when genius is supposed to be a form
of madness; a time with no great artists and no great
philosophers; a time without originality and yet with the
most foolish craving for originality; a time when the cult
of the Virgin has been replaced by that of the Demi-vierge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
It is the time when pairing has not only been
approved but has been enjoined as a duty.</p>

<p>But from the new Judaism the new Christianity may be
pressing forth; mankind waits for the new founder of religion,
and, as in the year one, the age presses for a decision.
The decision must be made between Judaism and Christianity,
between business and culture, between male and
female, between the race and the individual, between unworthiness
and worth, between the earthly and the higher
life, between negation and the God-like. Mankind has the
choice to make. There are only two poles, and there is no
middle way.</p>

<h3><span class="chapno">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
WOMAN AND MANKIND</h3>

<p>At last we are ready, clear-eyed and well armed, to deal
with the question of the emancipation of women. Our
eyes are clear, for we have freed them from the thronging
specks of dubiety that had hitherto obscured the question,
and we are armed with a well-founded grasp of theory, and
a secure ethical basis. We are far from the maze in which
this controversy usually lies, and our investigation has got
beyond the mere statement of different natural capacity
for men and women, to a point whence the part of women
in the world-whole and the meaning of her relation to
humanity can be estimated. I am not going to deal with
any practical applications of my results; the latter are not
nearly optimistic enough for me to hope that they could
have any effect on the progress of political movements. I
refrain from working out laws of social hygiene, and content
myself with facing the problem from the standpoint of that
conception of humanity which pervades the philosophy of
Immanuel Kant.</p>

<p>This conception is in great danger from woman. Woman
is able, in a quite extraordinary way, to produce the impression
that she herself is really non-sexual, and that her
sexuality is only a concession to man. But be that as it
may, at the present time men have almost allowed themselves
to be persuaded by woman that their strongest and
most markedly characteristic desire lies in sexuality, that it
is only through woman that they can hope to satisfy their
truest and best ambitions, and that chastity is an unnatural
and impossible state for them. How often it<span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span>
happens that young men who are wrapped up in their work
are told by women to whom they appeal and who would
prefer to have them paying them attention, or even as sons-in-law,
that &#8220;they ought not to work too hard,&#8221; that they
ought to &#8220;enjoy life.&#8221; At the bottom of this sort of advice
there lies a feeling on the woman&#8217;s part, which is none
the less real because it is unconscious, that her whole
significance and existence depend on her mission as a
procreating agent, and that she goes to the wall if man is
allowed to occupy himself altogether with other than sexual
matters.</p>

<p>That women will ever change in this respect is doubtful.
There is nothing to show that she ever was different. It
may be that to-day the physical side of the question is more
to the fore than formerly, since a great deal of the &#8220;woman
movement&#8221; of the times is merely a desire to be &#8220;free,&#8221; to
shake off the trammels of motherhood; as a whole the
practical results show that it is revolt from motherhood
towards prostitution, a prostitute emancipation rather than
the emancipation of woman that is aimed at: a bold bid for
the success of the courtesan. The only real change is man&#8217;s
behaviour towards the movement. Under the influence of
modern Judaism, men seem inclined to accept woman&#8217;s
estimate of them and to bow before it.</p>

<p>Masculine chastity is laughed at, and the feeling that
woman is the evil influence in man&#8217;s life is no longer understood,
and men are not ashamed of their own lust.</p>

<p>It is now apparent from where this demand for &#8220;seeing
life,&#8221; the Dionysian view of the music-hall, the cult of
Goethe in so far as he follows Ovid, and this quite modern
&#8220;coitus-cult&#8221; comes. There is no doubt that the movement
is so widespread that very few men have the courage
to acknowledge their chastity, preferring to pretend that
they are regular Don Juans. Sexual excess is held to be
the most desirable characteristic of a man of the world, and
sexuality has attained such pre-eminence that a man is
doubted unless he can, as it were, show proofs of his
prowess. Chastity, on the other hand, is so despised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span>
many a really pure lad attempts to appear a <i>blas&eacute; rou&eacute;</i>. It
is even true that those who are modest are ashamed of the
feeling; but there is another, the modern form of shame&mdash;not
the eroticist&#8217;s shame, but the shame of the woman who
has no lover, who has not received appraisement from the
opposite sex. Hence it comes that men make it their
business to tell each other what a right and proper pleasure
they take in &#8220;doing their duty&#8221; by the opposite sex. And
women are careful to let it be known that only what is
&#8220;manly&#8221; in man can appeal to them: and man takes their
measure of his manliness and makes it his own. Man&#8217;s
qualifications as a male have, in fact, become identical with
his value with women, in women&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>But God forbid that it should be so; that would mean
that there are no longer any <i>men</i>.</p>

<p>Contrast with this the fact that the high value set on
women&#8217;s virtue originated with man, and will always
come from men worthy of the name; it is the projection
of man&#8217;s own ideal of spotless purity on the object of his
love.</p>

<p>But there should be no mistaking this true chastity for
the shivering and shaking before contact, which is soon
changed for delighted acquiescence, nor for the hysterical
suppression of sexual desires. The outward endeavour to
correspond to man&#8217;s demand for physical purity must not
be taken for anything but a fear lest the buyer will fight
shy of the bargain; least of all the care which women so
often take to choose only the man who can give them most
value must not deceive any one (it has been called the
&#8220;high value&#8221; or &#8220;self-respect&#8221; a girl has for herself)! If
one remembers the view women take of virginity, there
can be very little doubt that woman&#8217;s one end is the
bringing about of universal pairing as the only means by
which they acquire a real existence; that women desire
pairing, and nothing else, even if they personally appear to
be as uninterested as possible in sensual matters. All this
can be fully proved from the generality of the match-making
instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span></p>

<p>In order to be fully persuaded of this, woman&#8217;s attitude
towards the virginity of those of her own sex must be
considered.</p>

<p>It is certain that women have a very low opinion of the
unmarried. It is, in fact, the one female condition which
has a negative value for woman. Women only respect a
woman when she is married; even if she is unhappily
married to a hideous, weak, poor, common, tyrannical,
&#8220;impossible&#8221; man, she is, nevertheless, married, has
received value, existence. Even if a woman has had a
short experience of the freedom of a courtesan&#8217;s life, even
if she has been on the streets, she still stands higher in a
woman&#8217;s estimation than the old maid, who works and
toils alone in her room, without ever having known lawful
or unlawful union with a man, the enduring or fleeting
ecstasy of love.</p>

<p>Even a young and beautiful girl is never valued by a
woman for her attractions as such (the sense of the beautiful
is wanting in woman since they have no standard in
themselves to measure it by), but merely because she has
more prospect of enslaving a man. The more beautiful a
young girl is, the more promising she appears to other
women, the greater her value to woman as the match-maker
in her mission as guardian of the race; it is only
this unconscious feeling which makes it possible for a
woman to take pleasure in the beauty of a young girl.
It goes without saying that this can only happen when
the woman in question has already achieved her own
end (because, otherwise, envy of a contemporary, and the
fear of having her own chances jeopardised by others,
would overcome other considerations). She must first
of all attain her own union, and then she is ready to help
others.</p>

<p>Women are altogether to blame for the unpleasant associations
which are so unfortunately connected with &#8220;old
maids.&#8221; One often hears men talking respectfully of an
elderly woman; but every woman and girl, whether married
or single, has nothing but contempt for such a one, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span>
when, as is often the case, they are unconscious that it is so
with them. I once heard a married woman, whose talents
and beauty put jealousy quite out of the question, making
fun of her plain and elderly Italian governess for repeatedly
saying that: &#8220;Io sono ancora una virgine&#8221; (that she was
still a virgin). The interpretation put on the words was
that the speaker wished to admit she had made a virtue of
necessity, and would have been very glad to get rid of her
virginity if she could have done so without detriment to her
position in life.</p>

<p>This is the most important point of all: women not
only disparage and despise the virginity of other women,
but they set no value on their own state of virginity (except
that men prize it so highly). This is why they look upon
every married woman as a sort of superior being. The
deep impression made on women by the sexual act can be
most plainly seen by the respect which girls pay to a married
woman, of however short a standing; which points to their
idea of their existence being the attainment of the same
zenith themselves. They look upon other young girls, on
the contrary, as being, like themselves, still imperfect beings
awaiting consummation.</p>

<p>I think I have said enough to show that experience confirms
the deduction I made from the importance of the
pairing instinct in women, the deduction that virgin worship
is of male, not female origin.</p>

<p>A man demands chastity in himself and others, most of
all from the being he loves; a woman wants the man with
most experience and sensuality, not virtue. Woman has
no comprehension of paragons. On the contrary, it
is well known that a woman is most ready to fly to the
arms of the man with the widest reputation for being a
Don Juan.</p>

<p>Woman requires man to be sexual, because she only
gains existence through his sexuality. Women have no
sense of a man&#8217;s love, as a superior phenomenon, they only
perceive that side of him which unceasingly desires and
appropriates the object of his affections, and men who have<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
none or very little of the instinct of brutality developed in
them have no influence on them.</p>

<p>As for the higher, platonic love of man, they do not
want it; it flatters and pleases them, but it has no significance
for them, and if the homage on bended knees
lasts too long, Beatrice becomes just as impatient as Messalina.</p>

<p>In coitus lies woman&#8217;s greatest humiliation, in love her
supremest exaltation. Since woman desires coitus and not
love, she proves that she wishes to be humiliated and not
worshipped. The ultimate opponent of the emancipation
of women is woman.</p>

<p>It is not because sexual union is voluptuous, not because
it is the typical example of all the pleasures of the lower
life, that it is immoral. Asceticism, which would regard
pleasure in itself as immoral, is itself immoral, inasmuch
it attributes immorality to an action because of the external
consequences of it, not because of immorality in the thing
itself; it is the imposition of an alien, not an inherent law.
A man may seek pleasure, he may strive to make his life
easier and more pleasant; but he must not sacrifice a moral
law. Asceticism attempts to make man moral by self-repression
and will give him credit and praise for morality
simply because he has denied himself certain things.
Asceticism must be rejected from the point of view of
ethics and of psychology inasmuch as it makes virtue the
effect of a cause, and not the thing itself. Asceticism is a
dangerous although attractive guide; since pleasure is one
of the chief things that beguile men from the higher path,
it is easy to suppose that its mere abandonment is
meritorious.</p>

<p>In itself, however, pleasure is neither moral nor immoral.
It is only when the desire for pleasure conquers the desire
for worthiness that a human being has fallen.</p>

<p>Coitus is immoral because there is no man who does not
use woman at such times as a means to an end; for whom
pleasure does not, in his own as well as her being, during
that time represent the value of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page337">[337]</span></p>

<p>During coitus a man forgets all about everything, he
forgets the woman; she has no longer a psychic but only
a physical existence for him. He either desires a child by
her or the satisfaction of his own passion; in neither case
does he use her as an end in herself, but for an outside cause.
This and this alone makes coitus immoral.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that woman is the missionary of sexual
union, and that she looks upon herself, as on everything else,
merely as a means to its ends. She wants a man to satisfy
her passion or to obtain children; she is willing to be used
by man as a tool, as a thing, as an object, to be treated as
his property, to be changed and modelled according to his
good pleasure. But we should not allow ourselves to be
used by others as means to an end.</p>

<p>Kundry appealed often to Parsifal&#8217;s compassion for her
yearnings: but here we see the weakness of sympathetic
morality, which attempts to grant every desire of those
around, however wrong such wishes may be. Ethics
and morality based on sympathy are equally absurd, since
they make the &#8220;ought&#8221; dependent on the &#8220;will,&#8221; (whether
it be the will of oneself, or of others, or of society, it is all
the same,) instead of making the &#8220;will&#8221; dependent on the
&#8220;ought&#8221;; they take as a standard of morality concrete
cases of human history, concrete cases of human happiness,
concrete moments in life instead of the idea.</p>

<p>But the question is: how ought man to treat woman?
As she herself desires to be treated or as the moral idea
would dictate?</p>

<p>If he is going to treat her as she wishes, he must have
intercourse with her, for she desires it; he must beat her,
for she likes to be hurt; he must hypnotise her, since she
wishes to be hypnotised; he must prove to her by
his attentions how little he thinks of himself, for she
likes compliments, and has no desire to be respected for
herself.</p>

<p>If he is going to treat her as the moral idea demands,
he must try to see in her the concept of mankind
and endeavour to respect her. Even although woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span>
is only a function of man, a function he can degrade
or raise at will, and women do not wish to be more
or anything else than what man makes them, it is no
more a moral arrangement than the suttee of Indian
widows, which, even though it be voluntary and insisted
upon by them, is none the less terrible barbarity.</p>

<p>The emancipation of woman is analogous to the emancipation
of Jews and negroes. Undoubtedly the principal
reason why these people have been treated as slaves and
inferiors is to be found in their servile dispositions; their
desire for freedom is not nearly so strong as that of the
Indo-Germans. And even although the whites in America
at the present day find it necessary to keep themselves quite
aloof from the negro population because they make such a
bad use of their freedom, yet in the war of the Northern
States against the Federals, which resulted in the freedom
of the slaves, right was entirely on the side of the emancipators.</p>

<p>Although the humanity of Jews, negroes, and still more of
women, is weighed down by many immoral impulses;
although in these cases there is so much more to fight
against than in the case of Aryan men, still we must try to
respect mankind, and to venerate the idea of humanity (by
which I do not mean the human community, but the being,
man, the soul as part of the spiritual world). No matter
how degraded a criminal may be, no one ought to arrogate
to himself the functions of the law; no man has the right
to lynch such an offender.</p>

<p>The problem of woman and the problem of the Jews are
absolutely identical with the problem of slavery, and they
must be solved in the same way. No one should be oppressed,
even if the oppression is of such a kind as to be
unfelt as such. The animals about a house are not
&#8220;slaves,&#8221; because they have no freedom in the proper
sense of the word which could be taken away.</p>

<p>But woman has a faint idea of her incapacity, a last
remnant, however weak, of the free intelligible ego, simply
because there is no such thing as an absolute woman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page339">[339]</span>
Women are human beings, and must be treated as such,
even if they themselves do not wish it. Woman and man
have the same rights. That is not to say that women ought
to have an equal share in political affairs. From the
utilitarian standpoint such a concession, certainly at present
and probably always, would be most undesirable; in New
Zealand, where, on ethical principles, women have been
enfranchised, the worst results have followed. As children,
imbeciles and criminals would be justly prevented from
taking any part in public affairs even if they were numerically
equal or in the majority; woman must in the same way
be kept from having a share in anything which concerns
the public welfare, as it is much to be feared that the mere
effect of female influence would be harmful. Just as the
results of science do not depend on whether all men accept
them or not, so justice and injustice can be dealt out to
the woman, although she is unable to distinguish between
them, and she need not be afraid that injury will be done
her, as justice and not might will be the deciding factor
in her treatment. But justice is always the same whether
for man or woman. No one has a right to forbid things
to a woman because they are &#8220;unwomanly&#8221;; neither
should any man be so mean as to talk of his unfaithful
wife&#8217;s doings as if they were his affair. Woman must be
looked upon as an individual and as if she were a free
individual, not as one of a species, not as a sort of
creation from the various wants of man&#8217;s nature; even
though woman herself may never prove worthy of such a
lofty view.</p>

<p>Thus this book may be considered as the greatest honour
ever paid to women. Nothing but the most moral relation
towards women should be possible for men; there should
be neither sexuality nor love, for both make woman the
means to an end, but only the attempt to understand her.
Most men theoretically respect women, but practically
they thoroughly despise them; according to my ideas this
method should be reversed. It is impossible to think highly
of women, but it does not follow that we are to despise<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
them for ever. It is unfortunate that so many great and
famous men have had mean views on this point. The views
of Schopenhauer and Demosthenes as to the emancipation
of women are good instances. So also Goethe&#8217;s</p>

<p>Men will have to overcome their dislike for masculine
women, for that is no more than a mean egoism. If
women ever become masculine by becoming logical and
ethical, they would no longer be such good material for man&#8217;s
projection; but that is not a sufficient reason for the present
method of tying woman down to the needs of her husband
and children and forbidding her certain things because they
are masculine.</p>

<p>For even if the possibility of morality is incompatible
with the idea of the absolute woman, it does not follow
that man is to make no effort to save the average woman
from further deterioration; much less is he to help to keep
woman as she is. In every living woman the presence of
what Kant calls &#8220;the germ of good&#8221; must be assumed; it
is the remnant of a free state which makes it possible for
woman to have a dim notion of her destiny. The theoretical
possibility of grafting much more on this &#8220;germ
of good&#8221; should never be lost sight of, even although
nothing has ever been done, or even if nothing could ever
be done in that respect.</p>

<p>The basis and the purpose of the universe is the good,
and the whole world exists under a moral law; even to the
animals, which are mere phenomena, we assign moral values,
holding the elephant, for instance, to be higher than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
snake, notwithstanding the fact that we do not make an
animal accountable when it kills another. In the case of
woman, however, we regard her as responsible if she commits
murder, and in this alone is a proof that women are
above the animals. If it be the case that womanliness is
simply immorality, then woman must cease to be womanly
and try to be manly.</p>

<p>I must give warning against the danger of woman trying
merely to liken herself outwardly to man, for such a course
would simply plunge her more deeply into womanliness.
It is only too likely that the efforts to emancipate women
will result not in giving her real freedom, in letting her
reach free-will, but merely in enlarging the range of her
caprices.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if we look the facts of the case in
the face there are only two possible courses open for
women: either to pretend to accept man&#8217;s ideas, and to
think that they believe what is really opposed to their
whole, unchanged nature, to assume a horror of immorality
(as if they were moral themselves), of sexuality (as if they
desired platonic love); or to openly admit that they are
wrapped up in husband and children, without being conscious
of all that such an admission implies, of the shamelessness
and self-immolation of it.</p>

<p>Unconscious hypocrisy, or cynical identification with
their natural instincts; nothing else seems possible for
woman.</p>

<p>But it is neither agreement nor disagreement with, but
rather the denial and overcoming of her womanishness
that a woman should aim at. If a woman really were to
wish, for instance, for man&#8217;s chastity, it would mean that
she had conquered the woman in her, it would mean that
pairing was no longer of supreme importance to her and
that her aim was no longer to further it. But here is
the trouble: such pretensions must not be accepted as
genuine, even although here and there they are actually
put forward. For a woman who longed for man&#8217;s purity
is, apart from her hysteria, so stupid and so incapable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
truthfulness that she is unable to perceive that she is in this
way negating herself, making herself absolutely worthless,
without existence!</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide which is preferable: the unlimited
hypocrisy which can appropriate the thing that is most
foreign to it, <i>i.e.</i>, the ascetic ideal, or the ingenuous admiration
for the reformed rake, the complacent devotion to him.
The principal problem of the woman question lies in the
fact that in each case woman&#8217;s one desire is to put all
responsibility on man, and in this it is identical with the
problem of mankind.</p>

<p>Friedrich Nietzsche says in one of his books: &#8220;To
underestimate the real difficulties of the man and woman
problem, to fail to admit the abysmal antagonism and the
inevitable nature of the constant strain between the two, to
dream of equal rights, education, responsibilities and duties,
is the mark of the superficial observer, and any thinker who
has been found shallow in these difficult places&mdash;shallow by
nature&mdash;should be looked upon as untrustworthy, as a
useless and treacherous guide; he will, no doubt, be one of
those who &#8216;briefly deal with&#8217; all the real problems of life,
death and eternity&mdash;who never gets to the bottom of things.
But the man who is not superficial, who has depth of
thought as well as of purpose, the depth which not only
makes him desire right but endows him with determination
and strength to do right, must always look on woman from
the oriental standpoint:&mdash;as a possession, as private property,
as something born to serve and be dependent on him&mdash;he
must see the marvellous reasonableness of the Asiatic instinct
of superiority over women, as the Greeks of old saw it,
those worthy successors and disciples of the Eastern school.
It was an attitude towards woman which, as is well known,
from Homer&#8217;s time till that of Pericles, grew with the
growth of culture, and increased in strength step by step,
and gradually became quite oriental. What a necessary,
logical, desirable growth for mankind! if we could only
attain to it ourselves!&#8221;</p>

<p>The great individualist is here thinking in the terms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span>
social ethics, and the autonomy of his moral doctrine is overshadowed
by the ideas of caste, groups, and divisions.
And so, for the benefit of society, to preserve the place of
men, he would place woman in subjection, so that the
voice of the wish for emancipation could no longer be
heard, and so that we might be freed from the false and
foolish cry of the existing advocates of women&#8217;s rights, advocates
who have no suspicion of the real source of woman
bondage. But I quoted Nietzsche, not to convict him of
want of logic, but to lead to the point that the solution of
the problem of humanity is bound up with the solution of
the woman problem. If any one should think it a high-flown
idea that man should respect woman as an entity, a
real existence, and not use her merely as a means to an
end, that he should recognise in her the same rights and
the same duties (those of building up one&#8217;s own moral
personality) as his own, then he must reflect that man
cannot solve the ethical problem in his own case, if he
continues to lower the idea of humanity in the women by
using her simply for his own purposes.</p>

<p>Coitus is the price man has to pay to women, under the
Asiatic system, for their oppression. And although it is true
that women may be more than content with such recompence
for the worst form of slavery, man has no right to
take part in such conduct, simply because he also is morally
damaged by it.</p>

<p>Even technically the problem of humanity is not soluble
for man alone; he has to consider woman even if he only
wishes to redeem himself; he must endeavour to get her to
abandon her immoral designs on him. Women must really
and truly and spontaneously relinquish coitus. That undoubtedly
means that woman, as woman, must disappear,
and until that has come to pass there is no possibility of
establishing the kingdom of God on earth. Pythagoras,
Plato, Christianity (as opposed to Judaism), Tertullian,
Swift, Wagner, Ibsen, all these have urged the freedom of
woman, not the emancipation of woman from man, but
rather the emancipation of woman from herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page344">[344]</span></p>

<p>It is easy to bear Nietzsche&#8217;s anathema in such company!
But it is very hard for woman to reach such a goal by her
own strength. The spark in her is so flickering that it
always needs the fire of man to relight it; she must have an
example to go by. Christ is an example; He freed the
fallen Magdalen, He swept away her past and expiated it for
her. Wagner, the greatest man since Christ&#8217;s time, understood
to the full the real significance of that act: until
woman ceases to exist as woman for man she cannot cease
being woman. Kundry could only be released from
Klingsor&#8217;s curse by the help of a sinless, immaculate man&mdash;Parsifal.
This shows the complete harmony between the
psychological and philosophical deduction which is dealt
with in Wagner&#8217;s &#8220;Parsifal,&#8221; the greatest work in the world&#8217;s
literature. It is man&#8217;s sexuality which first gives woman
existence as woman. Woman will exist as long as man&#8217;s
guilt is inexpiated, until he has really vanquished his own
sexuality.</p>

<p>It is only in this way that the eternal opposition to all
anti-feministic tendencies can be avoided; the view that
says, since woman is there, being what she is, and not to
be altered, man must endeavour to make terms with her;
it is useless to fight, because there is nothing which can be
exterminated. But it has been shown that woman is negative
and ceases to exist the moment man determines to be
nothing but true existence.</p>

<p>That which must be fought against is not an affair of
ever unchangeable existence and essence: it is something
which can be put an end to, and which ought to be put an
end to.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">This is the way, and no other, to solve the woman question,
and this comes from comprehending it. The solution
may appear impossible, its tone exaggerated, its claims overstated,
its requirements too exacting. Undoubtedly there
has been little said about the woman question, as women
talk of it; we have been dealing with a subject on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
women are silent, and must always remain silent&mdash;the
bondage which sexuality implies.</p>

<p>This woman question is as old as sex itself, and as young
as mankind. And the answer to it? Man must free himself
of sex, for in that way, and that way alone, can he free
woman. In his purity, not, as she believes, in his impurity,
lies her salvation. She must certainly be destroyed, as
woman; but only to be raised again from the ashes&mdash;new,
restored to youth&mdash;as a real human being.</p>

<p>So long as there are two sexes there will always be a
woman question, just as there will be the problem of mankind.
Christ was mindful of this when, according to the account
of one of the Fathers of the Church&mdash;Clemens&mdash;He talked
with Salome, without the optimistic palliation of the
sex which St. Paul and Luther invented later: death will
last so long as women bring forth, and truth will not
prevail until the two become one, until from man and
woman a third self, neither man nor woman, is evolved.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc
padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc">*</span></p>

<p>Now for the first time, looking at the woman question as
the most important problem of mankind, the demand for
the sexual abstinence on the part of both sexes is put
forward with good reason. To seek to ground this claim
on the prejudicial effects on the health following sexual
intercourse would be absurd, for any one with knowledge
of the physical frame could upset such a theory at all
points; to found it on the immorality of passion would also
be wrong, because that would introduce a heteronomous
motive into ethics. St. Augustine, however, must certainly
have been aware, when he advocated chastity for all mankind,
that the objection raised to it would be that in such a
case the whole human race would quickly disappear from
the face of the earth.</p>

<p>This extraordinary apprehension, the worst part of which
appears to be the thought that the race would be exterminated,
shows not only the greatest unbelief in individual
immortality and eternal life for moral well-doers; it is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
only most irreligious, but it proves at the same time the
cowardice of man and his incapacity to live an individual
life. To any one who thinks thus, the earth can only mean
the turmoil and press of those on it; death must seem less
terrible to such a man than isolation. If the immortal,
moral part of his personality were really vigorous, he would
have courage to look this result in the face; he would
not fear the death of the body, nor attempt to substitute
the miserable certainty of the continuation of the race
for his lack of faith in the eternal life of the soul. The
rejection of sexuality is merely the death of the physical
life, to put in its place the full development of the spiritual
life.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that it cannot be a moral duty to provide
for the continuance of the race. This common argument
appears to me to be so extraordinarily false that I am
almost ashamed to meet it. Yet at the risk of making
myself ridiculous I must ask if any one ever consummated
coitus to avoid the great danger of letting the human race
die out, if he failed in his duty? And would it not follow
that any man who prefers chastity would be open to the
charge of immoral conduct? Every form of fecundity is
loathsome, and no one who is honest with himself feels
bound to provide for the continuity of the human race.
And what we do not realise to be a duty, is not a duty.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it is immoral to procreate a human being
for any secondary reason, to bring a being into the limitations
of humanity, the conditions made for him by his
parentage; the fundamental reason why the possible freedom
and spontaneity of a human being is limited is that he was
begotten in such an immoral fashion. That the human race
should persist is of no interest whatever to reason; he who
would perpetuate humanity would perpetuate the problem
and the guilt, the only problem and the only guilt. The
only true goal is divinity and the union of humanity with
the Godhead; that is the real choice between good and
evil, between existence and negation. The moral sanction
that has been invented for coitus, in supposing that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
is an ideal attitude to the act in which only the propagation
of the race is thought of, is no sufficient defence. There is
no such imperative in the mind of man; it is merely an
ingenious defence of a desire, and there is the fundamental
immorality in it, that the being to be created has no power
of choice with regard to his parents. As for the sexual
union in which the production of children is prevented,
there is no possible justification.</p>

<p>Sexual union has no place in the idea of mankind, not
because ascetism is a duty, but because in it woman becomes
the object, the cause, and man does what he will with her,
looks upon her merely as a &#8220;thing,&#8221; not as a living human
being with an inner, psychic, existence. And so man
despises woman the moment coitus is over, and the woman
knows that she is despised, even although a few minutes
before she thought herself adored.</p>

<p>The only thing to be respected in man is the idea of
mankind; this disparagement of woman (and himself), induced
by coitus, is the surest proof that it is opposed to that
idea of mankind. Any one who is ignorant of what this
Kantian &#8220;idea of mankind&#8221; means, may perhaps understand
it when he thinks of his sisters, his mother, his female
relatives; it concerns them all: for our own sakes, then,
woman ought to treated as human, respected and not
degraded, all sexuality implying degradation.</p>

<p>But man can only respect woman when she herself ceases
to wish to be object and material for man; if there is any
question of emancipation it should be the emancipation from
the prostitute element. It has never until now been made
clear where the bondage of woman lies; it is in the sovereign,
all too welcome power wielded on them by the
Phallus. There can be no doubt that the men who have
really desired the emancipation of women are the men who
are not very sexual, who have no great craving for love,
who are not very profound, but who are men of noble and
spiritual minds. I am not going to try to palliate the
erotic motives of man, nor to represent his antipathy to
the &#8220;emancipated woman&#8221; as being in any sense less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span>
it is; it is much easier to go with the majority, than, as
Kant did, to climb, painfully and slowly, to the heights of
isolation.</p>

<p>But a great deal of what is taken for enmity to emancipation
is due to the want of confidence in its possibility.
Man does not really want woman as a slave: he is usually
only too anxious for a companion. The education which
the woman of the present day receives is not calculated
to fit her for the battle against her real bondage. The last
resource of her &#8220;womanly&#8221; teacher, if she declines to do
this or that, is to say that no man will have her unless she
does it. Women&#8217;s education is directed solely to preparing
them for their marriage, the happy state in which
they are to find their crown. Such training would have
little effect on man, but it serves to accentuate woman&#8217;s
womanishness, her dependence, and her servile condition.
The education of woman must be taken out of the hands
of woman; the education of mankind must be taken out
of the hands of the mother. This is the first step towards
placing woman in a relation to the idea of mankind, which
since the beginning she has done more than anything else
to hinder.</p>

<p class="center highline2"><span class="padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc
padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc padr10perc">*</span><span class="padl10perc">*</span></p>

<p>A woman who had really given up her sexual self, who
wished to be at peace would be no longer &#8220;woman.&#8221; She
would have ceased to be &#8220;woman,&#8221; she would have received
the inward and spiritual sign as well as the outward form of
regeneration.</p>

<p>Can such a thing be?</p>

<p>There is no absolute woman, but even so to say &#8220;yes&#8221;
to the above question is like giving one&#8217;s assent to a miracle.
Emancipation will not make woman happier; it will not
ensure her salvation, and it is a long road which leads to
God. No being in the transition stage between freedom
and slavery can be happy. But will woman choose to
abandon slavery in order to become unhappy? The
question is not merely if it be possible for woman to<span class="pagenum" id="Page349">[349]</span>
become moral. It is this: is it possible for woman really
to wish to realise the problem of existence, the conception
of guilt? Can she really desire freedom? This can happen
only by her being penetrated by an ideal, brought to the
guiding star. It can happen only if the categorical imperative
were to become active in woman; only if woman
can place herself in relation to the moral idea, the idea of
humanity.</p>

<p>In that way only can there be an emancipation of woman.</p>
